//! `repos` — git state over the repos a `repos.toml` registry declares.
//!
//! Exit codes: `0` when the command ran (what the report says is data, not
//! failure); `1` for a runtime failure, under `sync` for anything that
//! failed — a fetch (git's failure, or the tool's refusal to run one whose
//! refspec it can't confine: the entry went unsynced and a person must
//! act), a probe, or an action git refused (a rebase stopped by a conflict
//! is no failure: the branch stays diverged, a person's, as the report
//! says) — and under `push` for any target whose branch didn't end in sync
//! with its upstream (held, not ahead, a person's, a rebase its replay
//! stopped or whose push didn't land, no upstream, a remote branch in the
//! way, detached, unread, or a push that failed), as `git push` exits on a
//! rejected ref; `2` when the caller must change something — usage, a
//! missing or invalid registry, git missing or too old, an unknown target,
//! and under `push` the cwd in no entry's checkout, a third-party or pinned
//! target, or `--new-branch` in an agent's shell.
//!
//! A fatal error prints `error: …` and `hint: …` on stderr; under `--json`
//! it also prints one `ErrorReport` document on stdout, in place of the
//! report. An argument the parser rejects is reported before `--json` is
//! known, so it stays argh's text on stderr (exit 2) under `--json` too; so
//! does a non-UTF-8 argument.
//!
//! Busy detection reads the live Claude Code sessions recorded under
//! `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `~/.claude`, excluding the calling one
//! (`CLAUDE_PID`, when it's an ancestor of this process). Under
//! `CLAUDECODE` (an agent's shell) `sync` and `push` run as a person's —
//! but for `push --new-branch`, creating a remote branch, which is the
//! user's and refused there.
//!
//! The text summary wraps at `COLUMNS` (100 when unset or under 40), piped
//! or not, and colors its group labels only when stdout is a terminal and
//! `NO_COLOR` is unset or empty.
//!
//! `status --brief [<path>]` is the `SessionStart` nudge: at most one plain
//! line on the checkout holding the path (default: the cwd), from local
//! refs, probing that entry alone. It never fails its hook — every runtime
//! condition (no registry, the path in no entry, git missing, a failed
//! probe) exits `0` in silence — and only a flag it can't take, or a
//! second path, is a usage error (exit `2`, plain text on stderr, as
//! argh's own are).
