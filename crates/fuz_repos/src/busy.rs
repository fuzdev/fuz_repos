//! Busy detection: the checkouts the live Claude Code sessions (`sessions`)
//! sit in.
//!
//! `sync` acts, and agents may run it: without a guard one agent would
//! fast-forward a working tree another live session is editing, or push its
//! commits mid-stream. So a live session marks busy the checkout it works
//! in, and `classify` holds every action on the branches a busy checkout
//! has checked out, pushes included.
//!
//! A session works in each of its places (`Session::places`): its recorded
//! cwd, a roster worker's worktree, and its process's cwd — each scoped as
//! below, and the checkouts they mark joined.
//!
//! **Scope** (`scope_sessions`): a live session marks busy the checkout a
//! place of it sits in — the longest path-component prefix over every
//! checkout probed, linked worktrees included, both sides resolved as the
//! kernel would (a component that doesn't exist, such as a deleted dir,
//! taken as written; one that can't be looked up, such as behind a dir the
//! tool can't search or in a symlink loop, fails) — and a tie, one checkout
//! that's two entries' (a worktree of one at another's dir), marks both. It
//! marks busy too the checkout whose git dir git would find from it
//! (**Attribution**, below), and the checkouts where Claude Code would put
//! its agent worktrees (**Claude Code's own worktrees**, below), and the
//! checkouts whose lock names it (**Claude Code's worktree locks**, below).
//! A session none of these place — at the workspace root, outside every checkout, or
//! in an entry that wasn't probed — is unscoped and never blocks: ff-only
//! already protects uncommitted work, and a push only moves committed refs.
//!
//! A checkout whose path can't be resolved (`UnresolvedCheckout`, also a
//! `needs_human` reason) drops out of the scoping and may be busy:
//! `classify` holds every action on the branches checked out there, as for
//! a busy one — all of them when its HEAD is unknown. That's sound: a
//! session really inside it has a place that can't be resolved either (and
//! the run fails closed), or one that resolves into a shallower checkout
//! (which it then holds) or into none (unscoped) — and all that session
//! could have at stake is the checkout's own branch, which the hold covers.
//! Checkouts are resolved on every run, live sessions or none, so the
//! report doesn't change with whether another session happens to be
//! running.
//!
//! **Claude Code's own worktrees** (`nested_worktrees`): a subagent with
//! worktree isolation runs in its parent's process, so the session file
//! keeps the parent's cwd while the subagent commits in the worktree, which
//! the prefix scoping can't see. Claude Code puts it at
//! `<root>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`, `root` found from the session's cwd:
//! the toplevel git finds there, mapped from a linked worktree to its
//! repo's — the dir holding the common dir when that's named `.git` (the
//! primary checkout), else the common dir itself (a bare repo, or a
//! `--separate-git-dir` one) — unless the worktree's link back to its git
//! dir doesn't name it (moved by hand), when it's the toplevel itself. So
//! each entry a session is placed in has its repo's root (`claude_root`),
//! and a place attributed through a `.git` that isn't a linked worktree's
//! at its listed path has that dir too — a primary's toplevel, a moved or
//! copied worktree's, an unlisted git dir's. The session marks busy every
//! checkout, probed or unprobed, under each root's `.claude/worktrees/`
//! (resolved, by path component) — those paths exactly: never a subdir's,
//! which Claude Code doesn't use, nor a linked worktree's own. A session
//! in a `--separate-git-dir` primary holds the git dir's too, which Claude
//! Code roots only its linked worktrees' sessions at. Those checkouts are
//! busy with it for the holds, but it doesn't work in them itself, so they
//! aren't in its entry's `working`: a subagent's worktree there is known
//! as its own by the lock Claude Code puts on it (below).
//!
//! **Attribution** (`attributed`): a checkout's files needn't be at its
//! path. A worktree moved with a plain `mv` (git lists it prunable at the
//! old path, and keeps working at the new one), copied with `cp -a`, on
//! media mounted somewhere else, or with a `gitdir` naming no path (its
//! only path is then its own git dir) holds files the prefix scoping can't
//! see. So each live session is also placed the way git discovers its
//! repo: walking up from each resolved place to `/`, at each dir the `.git`
//! there — a dir, or a gitfile's `gitdir: ` path, relative to its dir — or
//! else the dir itself (git takes a git dir for a bare repo, so a session
//! inside one works in it). The nearest naming a checkout's own git dir
//! marks that checkout busy: a linked worktree's
//! `<commondir>/worktrees/<id>`, probed or not, or a primary's (a
//! `--separate-git-dir` primary's `.git` is a file naming it). That's sound
//! because git finds a worktree no other way: a session that can commit
//! through one, moving the branch checked out there, has that worktree's
//! `.git` (or git dir) on its walk up, so it's attributed to it wherever
//! its files are. A session placed both ways — a worktree moved into
//! another checkout's tree — is busy in both.
//!
//! A git dir no worktree list names can still share a repo's refs: made by
//! hand, with a `commondir` file naming the repo's common dir, or by
//! `git-new-workdir`, whose `.git` symlinks `refs` into the original's (or
//! by hand with only `refs/heads` symlinked). A session working through one
//! is on that entry's `unlisted`, and `classify` holds the branch its
//! `HEAD` names as though busy — every branch when that `HEAD` is unknown.
//! Its `commondir` and `HEAD` are read as git reads them (`gitdir`); one
//! past the tool's own read limit is passed over (a `commondir`, where git
//! might follow it) or unknown (a `HEAD`, which holds every branch).
//!
//! Everything else at a `.git` is passed over, and the walk goes on. Git
//! passes over a `.git` it can't look up (a dir it can't search, a symlink
//! loop) or that's no dir or regular file, and stops with an error at a
//! gitfile it can't read, over its 1 MiB limit, or not starting `gitdir: `,
//! or naming no git dir — so no session commits through any of them. A
//! gitfile is read exactly as git reads it (`gitdir::read_gitfile`), so
//! every gitfile git follows is followed. A git dir the probe doesn't know
//! is passed over as the prefix scoping passes over repos it doesn't know
//! (a session in a repo nested in a moved worktree is still in the
//! worktree's files).
//! Walking on only attributes more, and a `.git` never makes detection
//! unavailable. The walk is one stat per level, a bounded read of a `.git`
//! file, and a few lookups in a git dir the probe doesn't know.
//!
//! **Claude Code's worktree locks** (`sessions::claude_lock`): Claude Code
//! locks each worktree it creates or resumes by name (`EnterWorktree`, a
//! subagent's), and one a background session adopts as it starts, with
//! the reason `claude <agent|session> <name> (pid <pid> start <start>)`:
//! its own process's pid and `starttime` (field 22 of `/proc/<pid>/stat`,
//! as a session file's `procStart` records it), ` start <start>` left out
//! where it has none. A checkout whose lock names a live session is busy
//! with it, wherever the session's places are: probed or unprobed (a missing
//! worktree's lock is what git keeps it for), the primary included. The
//! reason is read as Claude Code's own parser reads it, and names a
//! session as Claude Code's own liveness check would: the pid is one of
//! the reader's live sessions — so never the caller, and only a process
//! the reader vouched for, which Claude Code's is, the session's own — and
//! a start, when given, is that session's `starttime` to the digit, so a
//! lock left behind by a process whose pid was since reused names no one.
//! A lock naming no live session is passed over. The reasons are the
//! worktree list's, which the probe reads anyway; a worktree git doesn't
//! list has none. Entering an existing worktree by path doesn't lock it:
//! that session is placed by its rewritten cwd.
//!
//! **Limits.** Only discovery from a session's places is seen: a session
//! pointing git elsewhere (`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`,
//! `-C`, `--git-dir`) is placed by its places alone — the limit an
//! unscoped session carries too — as are its edits by absolute path.
//! Claude Code roots agent worktrees at its tracked cwd, which the Bash
//! tool's `cd` moves without moving the process or the session file, so a
//! session launched at the workspace root can have agent worktrees in a
//! repo no place of it roots: those are caught by their lock alone.
//! Worktrees Claude Code doesn't lock — a `WorktreeCreate` hook's, or any
//! other tool's — are seen only as checkouts a place sits in. A lock names
//! a session only when the reader sees it, so the locks of a Claude process
//! the reader doesn't see are passed over (see `sessions`' **Limits**). And
//! the lock rule is pinned to Claude Code's current reason format: a change
//! to it silently drops that signal, which can't fail closed, since a
//! reason is free text anyone can write.
