//! Calls that reach a remote: why one failed, classified from git's stderr,
//! and the visibility check — an anonymous read of each repo declared
//! private.
//!
//! Classification is pure over the text git and its transports (ssh, curl)
//! print under `LC_ALL=C`, which the runner sets, plus the fetch refspecs a
//! missing ref is repaired against. `unreachable` and `repo_not_found`
//! carry the line that decided them, trimmed, and `failed` one trimmed line
//! — git's, or what the runner or a push's report said; `ref_gone` carries
//! the ref git named and the repair decided for it, `timed_out` the
//! runner's timeout, and `rejected` — a push's alone — the reason git gave
//! and the remote's own line, when it sent one. The not-run kinds are no remote's
//! answer: the probe refused to fetch (`refspec_outside_origin`,
//! `origin_refs_shared`, `legacy_remotes_unreadable`). Each kind is worded
//! once, here (`RemoteFailure::words`); a renderer may add a hint, but the
//! kind, its words, and any repair are decided here.
