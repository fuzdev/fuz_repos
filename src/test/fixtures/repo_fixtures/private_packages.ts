/**
 * Tests handling of private packages (private: true in package.json).
 * Private packages are excluded from version changes — they never publish, escalate, or
 * get an auto-changeset — while their dependents still publish normally. A private package
 * keeps its place in the topological order (publishing_order) but produces no version change.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - public_lib: Public package with explicit changeset
 * - private_tool: Private package with a changeset that will NOT be published (warns)
 * - consumer: Depends on public_lib (prod) and private_tool (dev)
