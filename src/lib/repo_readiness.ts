/**
 * Whether each configured repo sits where the registry puts it, read from the
 * entries `repos status --json` reports: the facts `gitops_publish --wetrun`
 * gates on, the ones `gitops_sync` refuses or warns on, and the at-rest block
 * the read-only diagnostics print.
 *
 * Pure — a report's facts in, problems and their messages out; no git calls.
 * The facts are decided on the Rust side (`at_rest`, `fetch_error`, a
 * checkout's `busy`, `needs_human`); this reads them, never re-derives them.
 *
 * Three readings:
 *
 * - **at rest** (`repo_readiness_at_rest`) — the primary checkout on the
 *   branch the entry follows, clean (untracked files count), no operation in
 *   progress, and that branch in sync with its origin upstream as of the
 *   local remote-tracking refs. What the diagnostics report.
 * - **ready to publish** (`repo_readiness_for_publish`) — at rest, except
 *   that the followed branch may be ahead of origin (origin's tip is then an
 *   ancestor, so the plan misses nothing and the release push is still a
 *   fast-forward), and also fetched without error (so the relation is
 *   origin's current word), no other live Claude Code session in the primary
 *   checkout (the executor commits there), and nothing the entry leaves to a
 *   person (`needs_human`).
 * - **ready to generate** (`repo_readiness_for_gen`) — what `gitops_sync`
 *   needs before it writes the dashboard's site data: the primary checkout
 *   on its branch, clean, and idle, since the site pairs each repo's local
 *   tree with origin's CI. The followed branch's relation to origin and a
 *   failed fetch only warn.
