## Common Errors

### "the `repos` binary was not found on PATH" or "prints status format …"

Every task reads repo state from `repos status --json`, and the `repos` binary
isn't in the npm package. Install it from a checkout of this repo at the
version of `@fuzdev/fuz_repos` you use — its format version must match the
package's:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/fuz_repos --locked
```

### "the gitops config lists `…`, which the registry (repos.toml) doesn't name"

The config lists `repos.toml` keys, not URLs, dir names, or paths; the message
suggests the keys it resembles.

### "a configured repo can't be loaded" or "configured repos can't be loaded"

Each problem names a key in `gitops.config.ts`:

- **the dir of another entry, not a registry key** — list the key it names
- **a third-party reference** — the config lists owned repos only
- **missing** — `repos sync <key>` clones it
- **isn't a git repo** or **probing failed** — `repos status <key>` shows what
  it found
- **private, and a public package** — `gitops_sync` writes each repo's
  metadata into the host's public `repos.json`, so a public host can't list
  repos the registry declares private

When no `repos.toml` is found walking up from the cwd, pass
`--registry <path>`.

### "not publishing, and nothing was changed: … each must be ready"

`gro gitops_publish --wetrun` fetches every npm repo in the config and refuses
unless each is ready. It moves nothing to get there, so the refusal changes
nothing; each line names a repo, what's wrong, and the fix:

- **on `feature`, not `main`** (or **detached at …**) — the primary checkout
  isn't on the branch the registry entry follows: switch back once the work
  there is committed or stashed
- **uncommitted changes (… staged, … unstaged, … untracked, … conflicted)** —
  commit, stash, or discard them; untracked files count. After a failed
  publish, see [Uncommitted changes after a failed `changeset publish`](#uncommitted-changes-after-a-failed-changeset-publish)
  before committing
- **a rebase is in progress** (or merge, cherry-pick, …) — finish or abort it
- **`main` is N commits behind origin** — `repos sync <key>` fast-forwards it
- **`main` has diverged from origin** — `repos sync <key>`, or `repos push`
  from its checkout, rebases it onto origin and pushes it when its commits
  replay cleanly (no conflict, none of them on another remote branch, no
  merge or tag among them, a clean checkout); otherwise rebase or merge by
  hand, then push
- **`main` tracks no upstream on origin**, **tracks an upstream gone from
  origin**, or **isn't compared with origin** — set or repoint its upstream;
  `repos status <key>` says what it found
- **fetching origin failed (…)** — fix the remote (network, auth, a gone ref)
  and rerun; `repos status --fetch <key>` retries the fetch
- **another live Claude Code session works in its checkout (pid …)** — the
  publish commits there, so wait for that session to finish
- **busy detection is unavailable (…)** — a session file couldn't be read or
  vouched for, so no checkout can be ruled out; `repos status` says why
- **origin isn't the registry's repo**, or another `needs_human` reason —
  `repos status <key>` names the fix

A branch ahead of origin isn't refused (see
[Readiness](publishing.md#readiness)).

It gates every npm repo, not just the ones being published: the plan reads
each one's changesets and versions, so a repo off its branch or behind origin
could make it wrong. The diagnostics (`gitops_plan`, `gitops_analyze`,
`gitops_validate`, the dry run) print the same problems as warnings, from
local refs, before you try.

### "not generating the site data: … on its registry branch, clean, and idle"

`gro gitops_sync` writes the dashboard's `repos.json` from each repo's working
tree beside origin's CI, so it refuses a repo that would show something else:
off the branch its registry entry follows, dirty (untracked files count), or
mid-operation — each line names the repo, what's wrong, and the fix, as the
publish refusal above does. It refuses before any fetch and changes nothing.
Move the repo back, or pass `--allow_dirty` to generate from the repos as they
sit, with each problem logged as a warning. `gro gitops_sync --check` prints
the same report from local refs, without a token, and exits non-zero when a
run would refuse.

It only warns on a branch behind or ahead of origin (the modules are the
local tree's, the CI origin's tip — `repos sync` lines them up), on a failed
fetch (the last fetch's view stands), and on an npm repo with no
`node_modules` or no `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` its tsconfig extends: the
library analysis then reads external types as `any`, and `gitops_sync`
installs nothing — run `npm install` and `gro sync` in that repo.

### "npm authentication failed"

Log in to npm:

```bash
npm login
npm whoami  # verify login
```

### "Preflight checks failed: [package] failed to build"

Fix the build errors before publishing:

```bash
cd path/to/package
gro build  # See the full build error
# Fix the errors
gro build  # Verify it works
```

Build validation runs during preflight checks to prevent broken state. Every
package the plan publishes — explicit changesets and auto-generated alike —
must build before any publishing begins.

### "Plan differs from actual publish"

The dry run (`gro gitops_publish`) reports the same cascade as `gro gitops_plan`
— including bump escalations and auto-generated changesets — so the preview and
the plan always agree. If they ever disagree, regenerate both and compare.

A real publish (`--wetrun`) executes that plan and **fails loud** if a published
version diverges from the plan's prediction — it aborts with a `drift` failure
rather than silently continuing. The executor reads the version back from the
repo's `package.json` after `gro publish`, so npm propagation can't cause drift.
Drift means the version `changeset version` wrote isn't the plan's prediction:

- The changesets changed after the plan was generated (a commit that added or
  edited one leaves the branch ahead, which the re-check passes)
- The plan's version prediction disagrees with `changeset version` — a bug
  worth reporting

Solution: re-run `gro gitops_publish --wetrun`. It re-plans from the current
working tree (already-published packages drop out) and continues. The drifted
package is already on npm, but its dependents weren't rewritten, and the re-run
won't do it: update their ranges by hand, or add a changeset to them.

### "… isn't ready to publish, re-checked right before `gro publish`"

Right before each `gro publish`, the executor re-checks that repo as the gate
did (a fresh `repos status --fetch`) and aborts before touching npm unless it's
still ready. Something changed after the gate — another session pushed to
origin, a tracked file was edited, a session started working there. The
failure's code is `not_ready`; packages published before it stay published.
Fix what it names, then re-run `gro gitops_publish --wetrun` to resume.

### A release commit and tag left local (the push was rejected)

`gro publish` doesn't check its own `git push`. If origin moved in the seconds
between the executor's re-check and that push, git rejects it, but `gro
publish` still succeeds: the version is on npm and the cascade carries on.
Git's rejection in the output is the only sign. The release commit and its
`vX.Y.Z` tag stay local, on a branch now diverged from origin, and the next
publish's gate refuses it. Merge origin's branch in (a rebase would leave the
tag on a commit the branch no longer holds — which is why `repos sync` and
`repos push` leave a diverged branch with a tag on its local commits to a
person), push the
branch with `repos push`, and push the tag by hand, since `repos` never pushes
tags.

### Uncommitted changes after a failed `changeset publish`

A `gro publish` that fails partway through `changeset version` or `changeset
publish` can leave the tree dirty with the consumed changesets deleted. gro's
own advice there is `git reset --hard`: committing would drop the changesets,
so the retry would have nothing to publish. The readiness gate reports the dirt
without knowing which case it is — check `git status` before choosing.

### "Production dependency cycle: a → b"

Production/peer circular dependencies are plan errors that block publishing.
You must:

1. Identify the cycle in `gro gitops_analyze` output
2. Move one dependency to devDependencies
3. Or restructure to remove the cycle

Note: Dev dependency cycles are normal and allowed, reported as info.

### "Failed to publish pkg: `gro publish …` failed (code 1)"

`gro publish` ran and exited non-zero. Its output streamed live above the
failure, and the failure in the result, the `--emit_json` events, and the JSON
or markdown report repeats the end of its stderr — npm's `E401`/`ENEEDAUTH`
(log in with `npm login`), `EOTP` (the one-time password was missing or
expired), a failing `gro check`, and so on. Known secret shapes, like npm
tokens, are redacted from the message. The failure's code is `publish`;
packages published before it stay published. Fix it, then re-run `gro
gitops_publish --wetrun` to resume.

npm prompts for a 2FA one-time password on the terminal: the executor gives
`gro publish` the terminal's stdin, so answer the prompt when it appears.
Declining the prompt (Ctrl-C) fails that package like any publish error;
packages already published still get their dev-dependency commits and, under
`--deploy`, their deploys. npm prompts only when both stdin and the child's
stdout are a terminal; piping `gro gitops_publish`'s stdout without
`--emit_json` or a report format disables the prompt.

### "Failed to wait for package: Error: Timeout waiting for pkg@1.2.3 after 600000ms"

After each publish the executor waits for the new version to be visible on npm
before rewriting its dependents; this failure aborts the run. NPM propagation
can be slow. Either:

- Increase timeout with `--max_wait` (in ms; default is 10 minutes / 600000ms);
  past about 20 minutes the 30-attempt cap ends the wait first
- Check NPM registry status
- Verify package was actually published
- If verified published, re-run `gro gitops_publish --wetrun` to continue
  (already-published packages will be skipped). Its dependents weren't
  rewritten, and the re-run won't do it: update their ranges by hand, or add a
  changeset to them

## Unexpected Behavior

### "Auto-changeset generated when I didn't expect it"

This happens when:

- A dependency was published with a new version
- Your package has that dependency in dependencies or peerDependencies

This is correct behavior - packages must republish when their dependencies
change.

### "Why was my package deployed when it didn't publish?"

Deployment occurs for packages with ANY changes (not just published packages):

- Published in this run
- Production/peer dependencies updated
- Dev dependencies updated (requires rebuild/deploy)

This is correct behavior - dev dep changes require redeployment even without
version bumps.

### "analyze/plan show stale data or the wrong branch"

The diagnostics (`gitops_analyze`, `gitops_plan`, `gitops_validate`,
`gitops_publish` dry run) read each repo's working tree **as-is** — whatever
branch is checked out, including uncommitted changes. They move no ref: no
branch switch, no pull. Each prints a "not at rest" block naming the repos
off their registry branch, dirty, mid-operation, or out of sync with origin as
of the last fetch. To run against each repo's registry branch with the latest
changes:

```bash
repos sync       # fetch, fast-forward what's behind, push what's ahead
gro gitops_plan  # then read the repos at rest
```

`repos sync` never switches a branch or touches uncommitted work: a repo off
its branch or dirty stays as it is until you move it.

### "Package not publishing even though I have a changeset"

When the repo has changeset files but none yields a bump for its package, the
plan takes no bump from those files (it publishes only if a dependency update
gives it an auto-changeset) and warns, naming the repo and why — none of the
files parses, or none that parses names the package. Preflight builds only
what the plan publishes, so it builds the repo only when it publishes that way.
Check:

1. Changeset file is in `.changeset/` directory
2. Changeset file is not `README.md`
3. Changeset references the correct package name
4. Changeset has valid frontmatter format

### "How does resumption work after failures?"

Resumption is **automatic** and **natural**:

1. When `gro publish` succeeds, it consumes changesets
2. A single `gro gitops_publish --wetrun` run handles the full dependency cascade:
   the plan resolves it up front and the publish executes it in one pass
3. If publishing fails mid-way, re-run `gro gitops_publish --wetrun`:
   - It re-plans from the current working tree
   - Already-published packages have no changesets → drop out of the new plan
   - Failed packages still have changesets → retried automatically
   - Repos left ahead of origin by the run's own commits pass the gate (see
     [Readiness](publishing.md#readiness))
4. No state files needed, just re-run the same command!

This is safer than explicit state tracking because:

- No stale state files to confuse users
- No need to remember `--resume` flag
- The readiness gate catches incomplete operations
- Changeset consumption provides natural, foolproof resumption

## Debugging Tips

### View detailed dependency graph

```bash
gro gitops_analyze --format markdown --outfile deps.md
```

### Preview a publish's side effects

```bash
gro gitops_publish --preview  # the ordered publishes, npm waits, dependency rewrites, dev-dep updates, and (with --deploy) deploys a --wetrun would perform
```

### Find what stopped a real publish

```bash
gro gitops_publish --wetrun --format json --outfile result.json
```

`result.json`'s `events` list each package's outcome in order. A failure is a
`package_failed` event whose `code` says why — one of `drift` (the version
`changeset version` wrote isn't the plan's; its `error` names both),
`not_ready`, `network` (the npm wait), or `publish` (its `error` ends with the
end of `gro publish`'s stderr). `failed[]` names each failed package with its
`error` message as a string; when the executor itself threw (a plan with
errors, a failed preflight) it holds one entry named `FATAL_ERROR` carrying
the thrown message. A readiness refusal or a blocked plan throws before any
report is written. The report's events and failures and `--emit_json`'s live
stream mask secrets. Under `--emit_json`, or a report written to stdout rather
than `--outfile`, the task's log, the confirmation
prompt, and the stdout of `gro publish` and `gro deploy` go to stderr, out of
the JSON's way.

### Extra lines before the JSON on stdout

Gro prints `[<task>] invoking <task>` and `[<task>] → <task> …` before running
a task, out of the task's reach, so they lead stdout even under `--format json`
or `--emit_json`. Everything after is the document or the events (the log goes
to stderr). Write the report with `--outfile`, or skip the two lines
(`tail -n +3` at the default log level). If `.svelte-kit` is missing, gro runs `svelte-kit sync` first, and
its output can land there too.

### Check what changed since last publish

```bash
# In each repo
git log --oneline
ls .changeset/
```
