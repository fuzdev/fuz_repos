//! `repos push`: the gateway, the path an agent pushes by instead of `git
//! push`.
//!
//! It pushes the branch checked out in each target checkout, through
//! `sync`'s own push and under its policy — rebasing it first, through
//! `sync`'s own rebase, when it diverged from origin's — and nothing else.
//!
//! **The pipeline.** For the targets' entries alone, what `sync` runs before
//! it acts: probe each, fetching it first as `status --fetch` does (the
//! same hardened fetch, remote-tracking refs alone, and the visibility
//! check); read the live sessions after the fetches, the caller's own
//! excluded; classify. Then, for each target, read the branch its checkout
//! has checked out and act on that branch's verdict alone, when it's a push
//! or a rebase. A push is `Actor::push` — the one push `sync` makes, with
//! every re-check it makes right before (the live sessions, the branch as
//! classified, origin's push URL, the commits ahead) and its race closures
//! (the lease on the fetched tip, the registry's URL pushed to directly,
//! the remote-tracking ref moved by compare-and-swap: the `sync` module doc
//! says how).
//!
//! **A diverged branch is rebased, then pushed**, when it's one `sync`
//! rebases (`classify`'s `rebase_blocker` says which) — through
//! `Actor::rebase_and_push`, the one rebase `sync` makes and the push after
//! it, with the same guards and re-checks: its local-only commits replayed
//! onto the fetched tip, the branch and the target's checkout moved to the
//! replayed tip, and that tip pushed (`Rebased`). The target is a checkout,
//! so the move is always the checked-out one (`git switch -C`, in the
//! target's own checkout, a linked worktree's included; the replay itself
//! runs in the repo and writes commit objects alone). A conflict, or a
//! local commit whose change origin already has, stops it with nothing
//! moved (`RebaseRefused`), and any other diverged branch is `NeedsHuman`,
//! by its reason. A push the rebase's re-checks or the remote stop leaves
//! the branch rebased and ahead, the next run's to push. The report says
//! what moved — the tip replaced, the new one, the fetched tip under it —
//! since commit ids read before the run name the commits replaced, and
//! whatever was checked before it was checked on the old base.
//!
//! **Never** a fast-forward, a shallow move, a clone, or any branch but the
//! one checked out at a target: a branch behind is `NotAhead` (sync's to
//! fast-forward). The policy is sync's, and structural: owned entries only
//! (a third-party reference or a pin named is refused before anything runs,
//! `check_pushable`), never a force or a tag, and a remote branch created
//! only under `--new-branch`, below; a checkout another live session works
//! in holds the push (`busy`), and so does origin drift (`entry`, or
//! `push_url`). A branch's relation the run can't vouch for — its entry
//! held whole (origin drift among the reasons), or its fetch failed — holds
//! it whatever it reads, in sync included (`entry`, `fetch_failed`), so the
//! push never exits `0` on refs that aren't origin's. Whatever holds a push
//! holds the rebase before it.
//!
//! **Dirt matters only to a rebase.** A push of a branch ahead moves refs
//! alone, so it runs whatever the checkout holds. A rebase moves the
//! checkout to the replayed commits, so any uncommitted change in it —
//! staged, unstaged, or untracked, as `sync`'s rebase reads clean — holds
//! it (`dirty_checkout`), with nothing moved: committed, or stashed with
//! its untracked files (`git stash -u`), the next `repos push` rebases. So
//! does the branch checked out in several checkouts (`several_checkouts`).
//!
//! **`--new-branch`, the user's**: a branch with no upstream on origin —
//! none configured (`NoUpstream`), or origin's same-named branch as its
//! upstream, deleted there (`gone`) with commits on no remote (with none,
//! it was merged, and stays `NoUpstream`) — is created on the registry's repo
//! under its own name and made its upstream, as `git push -u` does
//! (`Actor::create`, the `sync` module doc says how). Only such a branch:
//! one with a live upstream on origin pushes as it would without the flag,
//! and one tracking another remote, or origin's branch under another name,
//! stays `NoUpstream`. A branch origin already has at another commit is
//! never overwritten or adopted (`RemoteBranchExists`), and one the fetch
//! refspec leaves out can't be tracked (`NeedsHuman`, `unmapped`). Every
//! hold on a push holds a creation, the failed fetch included. In an
//! archived repo such a branch is `NeedsHuman` (`archived_ahead`), with or
//! without the flag. An agent is refused it before anything runs
//! (`check_new_branch`).
//!
//! **An agent may run it** without `--new-branch`: its push, and the
//! rebase before it, is classified and made as a person's. It's the path
//! agents push by: the user's Claude Code settings deny them raw `git
//! push`.
