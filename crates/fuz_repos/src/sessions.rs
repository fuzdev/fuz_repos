//! The live Claude Code sessions on this machine, for busy detection:
//! `busy` scopes them to the checkouts they sit in.
//!
//! Claude Code's formats are read here, the reason it writes on a worktree
//! lock included (`claude_lock`), which `busy` matches against the live
//! sessions.
//!
//! **The reader** (`read_live_sessions`) reads every config dir it's given
//! — `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `~/.claude`, the same dir once — listing
//! `sessions/` and opening only `<pid>.json` files, plus the background
//! workers in `daemon/roster.json`, deduplicated by pid and cwd (a session
//! file's record wins over a worker's, whichever dir holds it). Both are
//! Claude Code's internal formats, so they parse leniently: unknown fields
//! are ignored, and only `pid`, `procStart`, `cwd` (absolute), a session
//! file's `pidDomain`, and a worker's `replPid`, `replProcStart`, and
//! `worktreePath` (absolute; and `pidDomain`, when present) are read. A
//! session is live iff `/proc/<pid>` exists and its `starttime` (field 22 of
//! `/proc/<pid>/stat`) equals the recorded `procStart`, which defeats pid
//! reuse. Dead entries — the roster keeps exited workers — are ignored, as
//! is a file that doesn't parse when no process has its pid: nothing live
//! could be behind it. Claude Code rewrites these files in place, so one
//! that can't be read or parsed is read once more after a moment before it
//! counts.
//!
//! **Where a session works** is more than its recorded `cwd`, Claude Code's
//! `originalCwd`: the dir it was launched in, rewritten when it enters or
//! exits a worktree or resumes a session, but never moved by the Bash
//! tool's `cd`. A worker dispatched with worktree isolation records the
//! worktree too (`worktreePath`). And each live session carries its
//! process's cwd as `/proc/<pid>/cwd` names it, when that isn't the
//! recorded one, read before its liveness is checked (so a pid reused
//! since can't lend its cwd): Claude Code moves its process into a worktree
//! it enters, which the rewritten `cwd` mostly says already, so it's a
//! defense more than a signal of its own. Both are additive: a link that
//! can't be read (another user's process, a non-dumpable one, or one that
//! just exited), names a dir since removed, or isn't UTF-8 adds nothing,
//! and the recorded cwd still applies.
//!
//! **The caller** is excluded — the session `$CLAUDE_PID` names, and a
//! roster worker whose `replPid` it is — but only when that pid is an
//! ancestor of this process (`caller_ancestors`, by the ppid chain in
//! `/proc`). Anything else can set the variable, and a claim the process
//! tree doesn't back excludes nothing.
//!
//! **Fail closed.** No sessions dir means nothing is live. But a live
//! session the reader can't vouch for makes detection `Unavailable`, and
//! then every push, fast-forward, move, and rebase is held: a file that
//! doesn't parse while a process has its pid, a `pidDomain` (machine id and
//! pid namespace) other than the tool's own, where `/proc` can't speak for
//! its pid, a file or dir that can't be read, `HOME` unset (Claude Code falls
//! back to the passwd entry's home, which the tool doesn't read, so a
//! `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` alone isn't every dir), a config dir given as a
//! relative path (which the tool's cwd would resolve, not the session's), a
//! session's cwd (or worktree, or process cwd) that can't be resolved (when
//! `busy` scopes it), or no `/proc` at all (not Linux, or not mounted) while
//! anything is recorded. A format change degrades `sync` to fetching; it
//! never silently drops the guard.
//!
//! **Limits.** A Claude process that writes no session file and is no
//! roster worker is invisible — an out-of-process agent-team teammate, or
//! an interactive session started inside another session's environment —
//! and so is one whose `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` names a dir the tool doesn't
//! read.
