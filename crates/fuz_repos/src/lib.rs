//! `fuz_repos` — deterministic git operations over the repos a `repos.toml`
//! registry declares.
//!
//! **Load a registry, get a report.** Each command is one call:
//! `status::status_report`, `sync::sync_report`, and `push::push_report`
//! take a git runner (`git::Git`), the cwd, where the registry is
//! (`discover::Locate`; the default finds it walking up from the cwd), the
//! targets, and the command's options, and return the finished document
//! `repos --json` prints (`report::StatusReport`, `SyncReport`,
//! `PushReport`) with the run's timings. The run's policy is theirs: which
//! references it refreshes, when the unregistered scan runs, and what of
//! it the report carries, so any caller gets the binary's verdicts.
//! `status::checkout_status` is `status --brief`'s probe of the one
//! checkout holding a path; `discover::Workspace::load` is the loading
//! alone.
//!
//! Beneath them, public for a caller driving one phase (and for the
//! integration tests): the registry (`registry`: parsed, then validated
//! into the `ValidRegistry` that alone yields entries), finding it and
//! resolving targets (`discover`), the unregistered scan (`scan`), the
//! runs over resolved entries (`status::status`, `sync::sync`,
//! `push::push`, a missing entry's clone through `clone`), and the live
//! Claude Code sessions busy detection reads (`sessions`). The report's
//! vocabulary is `report`, `state`, `classify` (entry-level reasons,
//! `Refresh`), `remote` (what a remote's answers mean), and `error`. The
//! probe, busy detection's scoping, URL parsing and redaction (`url`), path
//! resolution (`paths`), and git's files and output formats are private.
//! The `repos` binary parses arguments, renders reports, and owns exit
//! codes.
//!
//! **What it writes.** The tool moves refs it didn't author and reports git
//! state: it fetches, fast-forwards, moves shallow branches with no local
//! commits, clones, and pushes commits that already exist — and replays a
//! diverged registry branch's local-only commits onto the fetched upstream
//! (the rebase `sync` makes, and `push` of the branch it's asked to push),
//! new commit objects carrying the same changes, messages, authors, and
//! author dates. It never makes a commit of new content or a tag, resolves
//! a conflict, merges anything but a fast-forward, force-pushes, deletes a
//! branch, or prunes a worktree. `status` writes nothing, and `status
//! --fetch`'s fetch writes remote-tracking refs and what a fetch needs
//! behind them (objects, `FETCH_HEAD`, the shallow boundary) — never a
//! tag; `sync` writes the branch it acts on, the checkout that branch is
//! on, the commits a rebase replays, and new clones. `push` writes, beyond
//! its fetch, only one branch's rebase — when the branch it's asked to push
//! diverged — and then the push. A push, `sync`'s or `push`'s, writes one
//! remote branch of an owned entry, under a lease (on the fetched tip, or
//! on none for `--new-branch`), then its remote-tracking ref (and, for
//! `--new-branch`, the upstream config). Authoring content — commits,
//! changesets, release tags — and package meaning (npm, the dependency
//! graph, the GitHub API) are left to the tools around it.
//!
//! Unix-only: it takes git's paths as raw bytes, as git does. Busy
//! detection reads `/proc`, so it works on Linux alone; elsewhere, with any
//! session recorded, it fails closed.
