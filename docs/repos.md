# The `repos` tool

`repos` reports and converges the git state of every repo a `repos.toml`
registry declares, and is the gateway agents push through. It lives in this
repo as the `crates/fuz_repos` crate (a library plus the `repos` binary), a
Cargo workspace beside the SvelteKit app; gro never invokes cargo.

What it may write, what it never does, and how it divides the work with the
TS tasks and gro: [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#scope-and-boundaries). This doc is
the per-command reference.

## Install

```bash
cargo install --path crates/fuz_repos --locked # install the `repos` binary
```

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain (rustup fetches it on first build),
and git must be 2.44 or newer (`GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH` keeps a local `status` on
a partial clone off the network; `git replay`, which sync's rebase runs, is
as old). It's Unix-only, and busy detection reads
`/proc`, so it works on Linux alone; elsewhere, with any session recorded, it
fails closed.

## Commands

```bash

repos status gro .           # narrow to targets: a key, a dir name, or a path inside a checkout (each names its entry); a named reference previews its refresh

## Finding the registry

`repos` finds its registry by walking up from the cwd (its physical path) to
the first `repos.toml` (from a linked worktree outside the workspace, it walks
up from the repo's main checkout instead), and the **workspace root is the
directory holding it as found** — entry dirs resolve against that root —
except inside a checkout (the nearest `.git` at or above it): there the root
is the nearest directory above that checkout whose `repos.toml` is the same
file (same device and inode, through symlinks; unreadable ones passed over).

So a registry kept in one of the workspace's own repos, with a `repos.toml`
symlink to it at the workspace root, roots the workspace at the link's dir
from inside that repo too, and from its linked worktrees, whose own committed
copy defers to the main checkout's. Nearest, so the innermost workspace wins:
a stray link further out never captures it, a link inside the repo doesn't
root it, and a different registry above neither roots nor stops the search.

A root found this way that is still in a checkout whose `origin` names one of
the registry's entries (no link at the root yet, say) is refused
(`root_in_entry`, exit `2`) — rooted there, a sync would clone the fleet into
that checkout. `--registry` naming a file makes _its_ directory the root as
given, with no search or check, unless `--root <dir>` names it; `--root`
alone skips the check too.

## `repos status`

`repos status` reports every registry entry's branches and their relation to
origin, uncommitted work in each checkout (linked worktrees too), what needs a
human, which checkouts another live Claude Code session is working in, and the
clones at the workspace root the registry doesn't name, grouped by what to do
next: `sync would` lists what `repos sync` would do — `push`, `ff`, `move`,
`rebase` (a diverged registry branch: see [`repos sync`](#repos-sync)),
`clone` — `held` what it would but for a hold, and `needs human` what it
leaves to a person, a diverged branch it doesn't rebase among them. It reads local refs alone; `--fetch` refreshes them first (see
[Fetching](#fetching)). Without `--fetch` it writes nothing: optional locks
are off (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`), and so is lazy fetching.

How fresh the remote view is (`fetched_at`, the footer's oldest and its
`never` count) is the newest non-empty `FETCH_HEAD` across the repo's git
dirs; a repo with no `FETCH_HEAD` at all — a fresh clone writes none — is
dated by git's own `clone: from` entry, the first line of its `logs/HEAD`
(none for a clone of an empty repo, or one whose refs are in the reftable
format, which reads as never fetched). An empty `FETCH_HEAD` means the last
fetch failed, so its age is unknown and reads as never fetched, clone or not.

In the default view each entry's `uncommitted` item totals its primary
checkout's dirt, then names its one other dirty worktree, or folds several
into a count with their summed dirt; `--verbose` lists every dirty checkout
with its dirt by kind.

## At rest

Each entry's `at_rest` in the `--json` report says whether its own checkout
— the primary, `checkouts[0]` — sits where the registry puts it. It's
decided with the verdicts, so a consumer reads readiness rather than
re-deriving it from the checkout and its branches:

- `on_branch` — HEAD is on the branch the entry follows (its `branch`);
  `false` when detached or on another branch, `null` when the entry follows
  none (a reference declaring no `branch`)
- `clean` — nothing staged, unstaged, untracked, or conflicted
- `idle` — no operation in progress
- `followed` — the followed branch's relation to origin, as its entry in
  `branches` carries it; `null` when the entry follows no branch, has no
  local branch of that name, or its branches aren't compared against a
  remote — a third-party reference the run doesn't refresh, whose branches
  with local work read `untracked` for want of a comparison

`at_rest` itself is `null` exactly when `checkouts` is empty: the entry is
missing or not a repo, or its probe failed (`probe_error`). A pin's facts are
decided as any entry's; that it's pinned is its own field. The text
summary's `clean · on branches · pinned` counts read `on_branch`. The gitops
tasks read readiness from these facts: `gro gitops_publish --wetrun` refuses
a repo not at rest (see [Publishing](publishing.md#readiness)),
`gro gitops_sync` refuses one off its branch, dirty, or mid-operation (see
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)), and the diagnostics list them.

Readiness wants `followed` too: a followed branch that's unborn (no commit
yet) reads `on_branch` true, clean, idle, and `followed` `null`, beside a
`default_branch_missing` reason unless the entry is pinned. `at_rest` says nothing of live
sessions — `checkouts[0].busy` does. And `followed` is as fresh as the
remote-tracking refs, as `branches` is: as of `fetched_at`, and stale after
a failed `--fetch`.

A failed probe's `probe_error` is an object: its `kind` — the entry's path
couldn't be looked up (`path_unreadable`) or isn't UTF-8
(`non_utf8_path`); a read with a kind of its own failed, however it failed
(`config_unreadable`, `fetch_url_unreadable`, `push_urls_unreadable`); or
another git call couldn't start (`git_not_run`), timed out
(`git_timed_out`), failed (`git_failed`), or printed what the probe can't
read (`unexpected_output`) — and a `message` for display. The text output
prints the message. A HEAD that can't be read — an unprobed worktree's, or
an unlisted git dir's — is `null`; a readable one is `branch` or
`detached`, as a probed checkout's is.

## `repos status --brief`

`repos status --brief [<path>]` is the nudge a user-scope `SessionStart` hook
runs as `repos status --brief "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"`: its stdout lands in the
new session's context, so it prints nothing unless the checkout holding the
path has something that session should know, and one plain line otherwise —
`repos: <key> — …` naming, in order:

1. the other live sessions working in that checkout itself (placed there by
   where they are or by the lock Claude Code put on it for them — not a
   session elsewhere in the repo, which sync still counts busy in the
   `.claude/worktrees/` checkouts, for the subagents it may have there)
2. an operation in progress there
3. its branch behind or diverged from its origin upstream (with how long ago
   the repo was fetched)
4. ahead of it (unpushed)

Behind and ahead are said only for an owned entry that isn't pinned, and dirt
never (the session sees its own working tree). It probes that entry alone,
from local refs — no fetch, no unregistered scan, nothing written — and finds
the registry walking up from the path (its physical path, as for the cwd)
rather than the cwd. The caller is excluded from the sessions as anywhere
(`CLAUDE_PID`, which Claude Code sets for its hooks too), and with busy
detection unavailable it says nothing of sessions.

It never fails its hook: no registry, a refused root, a path in no entry (the
workspace root, an unregistered clone, outside the workspace), git missing, or
a failed probe all exit `0` in silence; only a flag it can't take (`--json`,
`--fetch`, `--verbose`, `--references`) or a second path is a usage error,
exit `2`.

## Fetching

`status --fetch` fetches owned entries that aren't pinned (and the references a
run refreshes) from origin before probing; `sync` and `push` run the same fetch first.

**Failures.** Each failed fetch gets a kind (`ref_gone`, `unreachable`,
`repo_not_found`, `timed_out`, …, else `failed` with git's line).

**Visibility.** Each `[repos]` entry declared private gets an anonymous `git
ls-remote` of its HTTPS URL with no credential in reach — readable means it
leaked, printed first as `visibility`.

**Confinement.** The fetch writes remote-tracking refs, the objects behind
them, `FETCH_HEAD`, and a shallow boundary, and nothing else — never a tag, a
submodule, or a commit-graph — whatever the repo's config says; an entry
whose refspecs could write outside `refs/remotes/origin/`, or another
remote's into it, isn't fetched, and
neither is an owned one whose fetch wouldn't reach the registry's repo as git
resolves origin's URL, `insteadOf` applied: the fetch would bring in another
repo's history. An origin set to another URL says so on its origin-drift
line; one set to the registry's that a rewrite sends elsewhere is a
needs-human `fetch_url_mismatch` naming the rewrite; and one spelled otherwise
that a rewrite sends to the registry's repo (an alias, `gh:me/app`) is
fetched, its drift still holding the rest.

**URLs.** Origin URLs are redacted wherever shown, and registry URLs are
strict (a plain DNS host, no userinfo or port). An origin or push URL names
the registry's repo only when read as git connects for it: the host (to the
first `/` after `scheme://`, or the first `:` in scp-like `user@host:path`) is
the registry's, with no port, and the path on it is `<account>/<name>`, case
folded, a `.git` or trailing `/` dropped — an `@` past the host, an escape
(git decodes those first), a bracket anywhere (git unwraps one into the host),
a user other than ASCII letters, digits, and `._+-`, or an IP literal never
matches.

The details live in the rustdoc of `remote.rs`, `probe.rs`, and `url.rs`.

## Busy detection

**What it reads.** Busy detection reads the live Claude Code sessions under
`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `~/.claude` — `sessions/<pid>.json` and the daemon
roster's workers, each verified against `/proc/<pid>/stat`'s start time —
excluding the caller (`CLAUDE_PID`, honored only when it's an ancestor of the
process).

**Where a session works.** A session works at its recorded cwd (Claude Code's
`originalCwd`, which entering or exiting a worktree rewrites), a roster
worker's `worktreePath`, and its process's current cwd (`/proc/<pid>/cwd`).
It marks busy:

- the checkout each of those sits in
- the checkout whose git dir the nearest `.git` above it names (so a worktree
  moved or copied by hand is busy wherever its files are)
- every checkout under the repo's main checkout's `.claude/worktrees/`
  (Claude Code's subagent worktrees, whose sessions keep the parent's cwd;
  for a bare or `--separate-git-dir` repo, the common dir's too, and for a
  moved worktree, its own)
- every checkout whose lock names it — Claude Code locks each worktree it
  creates with the reason `claude <agent|session> <name> (pid <pid> start
  <start>)`, matched against the session's pid and start time

A busy checkout holds every action on its branches, pushes included.

**What it can't see.** Claude Code roots agent worktrees at its tracked cwd,
which the Bash tool's `cd` moves without moving the process or the session
file, so such a worktree is caught by its lock alone; one Claude Code doesn't
lock (a `WorktreeCreate` hook's, another tool's), and work through `GIT_DIR`
or `git -C`, are placed by those paths alone. A Claude process that writes no
session file (an agent-team teammate, a session started inside another's
environment) or runs under a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` the tool doesn't read is
invisible, its locks with it, and a change to Claude Code's lock format
silently drops the lock signal.

**It fails closed.** A live session it can't vouch for (a file that won't
parse, another machine's or pid namespace's, no `/proc`, a path it can't
resolve), a file or dir it can't read, a relative `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or
`HOME`, or `HOME` unset makes detection unavailable, which holds every action
and prints on the `failed` line. A checkout whose path can't be resolved may
be busy: it holds the branches checked out there and shows as a `needs_human`
reason. So does a git dir no worktree list names that shares the repo's refs
(a hand-made `commondir`, or `git-new-workdir`) with a session in it, and a
branch git says is checked out in a worktree the probe didn't find. Sessions
in no checkout show only under `--verbose` and in the JSON.

The details live in the rustdoc of `sessions.rs` (the reader) and `busy.rs`
(the scoping).

## `repos sync`

`repos sync` is `status --fetch` followed by acting on each branch's verdict.
Beyond the fetch, it writes the branch it acts on, the checkout that branch is
on, the commit objects a rebase replays, the remote branch a push moves (and
its remote-tracking ref), and new clones.

**Fast-forwards and moves.** A branch behind is fast-forwarded — in place when
no checkout has it (a confined `git fetch .` of the exact upstream commit, so
git refuses a non-ff and a branch checked out anywhere), in its checkout with
`merge --ff-only --no-overwrite-ignore` only when that checkout is still on it
and clean — and a shallow branch with no local commits moves to the fetched
tip (`update-ref` compare-and-swap in place, `switch -C --no-overwrite-ignore`
in a clean checkout).

**Re-checks.** The live sessions are read after the fetch and again right
before each action, and each action re-checks what it relies on (and checks
after the fact what git can't refuse); git refusing is `failed`, exit `1` (as
is a failed probe, or a fetch that failed or that the tool refused to run). A
fast-forward in a checkout moves whatever branch HEAD is on when git runs, so
a branch switched in the instant after sync read the checkout may move forward
instead; the action then fails, naming it.

**Pushes.** A branch ahead is pushed to its upstream's branch on the
registry's repo — `git send-pack` of the commit classified straight to the
registry's SSH URL, never through `origin`, so no `insteadOf`,
`pushInsteadOf`, or `remote.<url>` config written in the meantime can redirect
it; under a lease on the fetched tip (`--force-with-lease=<ref>:<fetched>`),
no tags or push options, SSH only — once the branch still reads as
classified, origin's push URL (`git remote get-url --push --all`, `pushurl`
and `pushInsteadOf` applied) is exactly the registry's repo over SSH, and the
fetched tip is still an ancestor of the commit, the same count behind it.

The lease is a compare-and-swap, never a force over unseen work: git refuses
unless the remote's branch is exactly what the fetch saw, and the ancestor
check keeps the push a fast-forward. Any other push URL holds its pushes as a
`needs_human` reason, and an upstream at `origin/HEAD` (or outside
`refs/heads/`) is left to a person. A remote branch moved or deleted since the
fetch fails the lease (`held`, rerun — a deleted one then reads gone, so no
push recreates it but the user's `repos push --new-branch`, and only while it
has commits on no remote); the remote's own refusal or an unreachable host is
`push_failed`, exit `1`. After a push (or finding the commit already there,
another hand's push since the fetch) the remote-tracking ref moves to the
commit by compare-and-swap on the fetched tip, so `status` reads the branch in
sync without a refetch. That write is best effort: a ref a fetch moved in the
meantime stands, and one git can't write (a stale lock) leaves the outcome as
it is and the branch reading ahead until a fetch can write it.

**Rebases.** A registry branch diverged from origin's — local-only commits
here, new commits there, as when two machines commit to the same `main` — is
rebased, then pushed as any branch ahead is. `status` shows it under `sync
would` as `rebase <key> +<ahead> −<behind>`.

Only the branch the registry names, in an owned entry that's neither archived
nor pinned, whose upstream is origin's branch of the same name, outside a
partial clone, whose commits ahead are on no remote-tracking ref, with no
merge commit among them and no tag on one. Any other diverged branch stays
`needs human`, by why:

- `diverged` — not the registry's branch, or its entry (archived, pinned,
  third-party), its upstream (another name on origin), or a partial clone
  rules it out: a diverged feature branch is as likely a local rebase
  waiting on a force-push, which the tool never makes
- `diverged_published` — a commit it's ahead by is on another remote branch
  (a pushed `feat`, merged into `main` here by fast-forward): a rebase would
  rewrite a commit a remote holds
- `diverged_merge` — a merge commit among its local-only commits, which a
  replay doesn't carry
- `diverged_tagged` — a tag on one of them (a release whose push was refused,
  say), which a rebase would leave on a commit the branch no longer holds

A rebase is held by whatever holds a fast-forward (a dirty checkout —
untracked files count — an unprobed worktree, a live session, an operation in
progress, a failed fetch) and by whatever holds a push (origin's push URL
elsewhere).

The rebase is `git replay --onto <fetched tip> <fetched tip>..<branch>`, a
merge made in memory: it writes new commit objects — the same changes,
messages, authors, and author dates, committed by whoever runs the tool
(unsigned: a replay signs nothing, whatever `commit.gpgSign` says) — and no
ref, index, or working tree, and runs no hook. The committer is the identity
you configured: with no `user.name` and `user.email` (in config or the
environment), the rebase fails, saying to set them, rather than commit as the
login and host name git would guess.

So a conflict moves nothing and leaves no rebase in progress: nothing is ever
resolved — no merge strategy option, `rerere` off, and no merge driver, the
ones your config defines and git's built-in `union` alike, so a path a
`merge=` attribute would have merged conflicts like any other — and the branch
stays `needs human`, reading `diverged +n −m, rebase conflicts`. A local
commit whose change origin already has stops it the same way (`<commit> is
already upstream`): a replay would keep it as an empty commit where `git
rebase` drops it, and the tool makes neither choice. Only commits on no remote
are replayed, so nothing published is rewritten.

Then the branch moves to the replayed commits: in place by `update-ref`
compare-and-swap on the commit replayed, or in its clean checkout by the
shallow move's `switch -C --no-overwrite-ignore`, after the checkout and the
branch are read again — git refuses an ignored file the upstream now tracks
(`failed`, nothing moved). The old commits stay in the branch's reflog,
written whatever `core.logAllRefUpdates` says. Then the push, with its own
re-checks and lease: a fast-forward of linear history, never a force. When the
push is held or fails (origin moved again since the fetch, a ruleset refused
it), the branch stays rebased and ahead, and the next run pushes it, or
rebases it again.

`status` predicts a rebase from the facts alone and never runs a replay (it
writes nothing), so `sync would rebase` means sync would try.

**An agent's sync pushes and rebases as a person's does**: under `CLAUDECODE`
(Claude Code's agent shells) nothing is held for being an agent's — every
branch ahead or diverged that nothing else holds is pushed or rebased, commits
other, finished sessions made included — and busy detection keeps it off the
checkouts live sessions work in.

**What it leaves.** A branch that's a symbolic ref never acts. It never
resolves a conflict, rewrites a commit a remote holds, merges anything but a
fast-forward, deletes a branch, or prunes a worktree (the fetch prunes only
remote-tracking refs gone upstream), and never touches a pin. A branch whose
upstream is gone reads as cleanup, to delete by hand, except the branch the
entry follows: its upstream gone (the remote's default renamed, say) needs a
person. A failed fetch holds that entry's moves, rebases, and pushes (its
remote-tracking refs weren't refreshed), and a branch on HEAD in several
checkouts holds its fast-forward, move, or rebase.

**Sync outcomes.** Exit `0` when the run acted or held as its report says;
`1` when something failed — a fetch, a probe, an action git refused, or a push
that failed at the remote, a rebased branch's included. A hold is no failure,
and neither is a rebase its replay stopped (a conflict, a commit already
upstream): the branch is a person's, as any diverged branch left alone.
`--json` prints the entries after the fetch — the state sync acted on, not
the state it left: a branch `rebased`, `pushed`, or `fast_forwarded` still
reads `diverged`, `ahead`, or `behind` there — and each branch's outcome; a
rebase is `rebased` (`from`, `to`, `onto` the fetched tip, and `push`:
`pushed`, `already_there`, `held`, `push_failed`, or `failed`) or
`rebase_refused` (`why`: `conflicts`, or `already_upstream` with the
`commit`).

The rustdoc of `sync.rs` has the details.

## `repos push`, the gateway

`repos push` is what an agent runs instead of `git push`.

**Targets.** Without targets it pushes the branch checked out in the checkout
holding the cwd; a target is a registry key or dir name (the entry's own
checkout) or a path (the checkout holding it, a linked worktree's own).

**Pipeline.** For those entries alone it runs what sync runs before acting —
the same fetch, a re-probe, the live sessions read (the caller's own
excluded), classification — then acts on each checked-out branch's verdict
alone, when it's a push or a rebase: a branch ahead through sync's own push
(the lease, the direct URL, the compare-and-swap, every re-check right
before), a diverged one through sync's own rebase and then that push. It
never fast-forwards, moves a shallow branch, clones, or touches a branch
other than the one checked out at a target: a branch behind is reported for
`repos sync` to fast-forward.

**A diverged branch is rebased, then pushed**, when it's one [sync
rebases](#repos-sync) — the same branches, by the same rules. It's the same
action, with the same guards and re-checks: the local-only commits are
replayed onto the fetched tip, the branch and the target's checkout move to
the replayed commits (`switch -C --no-overwrite-ignore`, in the target's own
checkout — a linked worktree's too), and the new tip is pushed under the
lease. Any other diverged branch reads `needs human`, by the same reasons
(`diverged`, `diverged_published`, `diverged_merge`, `diverged_tagged`), and a
conflict — or a local commit whose change origin already has — stops the
rebase with nothing moved. A rebase is all `repos push` ever writes locally
beyond its fetch and the remote-tracking ref a push records: the commit
objects the replay makes, that one branch, and the checkout it's on.

A rebase changes what the caller knew: the branch's commits are new ones, so
commit ids read before the push are stale, and whatever was checked before it
(tests, a build) was checked on the old base. The report says what moved —
the text's `rebased` line says how many upstream commits the branch now sits
on, its new tip, and the tip replaced; the JSON's `rebased` outcome carries
`from`, `to`, and `onto` — and when the push that follows is held or fails
(origin moved again since the fetch, a ruleset refused it), the branch stays
rebased and ahead, and the next `repos push` pushes it, or rebases it again.

**Dirt matters only when the push must rebase.** A branch ahead pushes from a
dirty checkout, since a push moves refs alone. A diverged one is held
(`dirty_checkout`) by any uncommitted change in its checkout — staged,
unstaged, or untracked, the same reading of clean sync's rebase uses — with
nothing moved: commit, or `git stash -u`, then `repos push` again. A branch
checked out in several checkouts is held too (`several_checkouts`).

**Policy.** The policy is structural: owned entries only (a third-party
reference or a pin named is a usage error), never a force or a tag; another
live session in the checkout holds the push (`busy`), and so does origin
drift; a failed fetch or an entry-level reason (origin drift among them)
holds even a branch that reads in sync, since its refs may not be origin's (a
branch with no upstream configured reads `no_upstream` whatever the fetch,
since that's its config). Whatever holds a push holds the rebase before it.
It runs for an agent as for a person, the rebase included.

### `--new-branch`

A branch with no upstream on origin reads `no_upstream`: **creating the
remote branch is the user's**, with `repos push --new-branch`, which an
agent's shell (`CLAUDECODE`) is refused, exit `2`.

It creates a branch with no upstream configured, or whose same-named upstream
on origin is gone while it has commits on no remote (with none — merged, say
— `no_upstream`, recreated by hand only; never the branch the entry follows,
whose upstream gone is the remote's default renamed or deleted:
`no_upstream`, repointed by hand), as `refs/heads/<b>` on the registry's repo
— the same send-pack, under a lease that no such ref exists
(`--force-with-lease=<ref>:`), so one created there since the fetch is held,
never overwritten — then, as `git push -u`, the remote-tracking ref by
compare-and-swap on none and `branch.<b>.remote`/`.merge`, and reads
`created`.

A branch with a live upstream pushes as without the flag; one tracking
another remote, or origin's branch under another name, stays `no_upstream`;
one origin already has at another commit reads `remote_branch_exists` (never
adopted: set the upstream by hand), and one the fetch refspec leaves out
`needs_human` (`unmapped`). A run stopped between creating the branch and
setting its upstream is finished by the next `--new-branch`: the branch is on
origin at the very commit, the lease reads it up to date, and the upstream is
set.

### Push outcomes

Exit `0` when every target's branch ends in sync with its upstream (pushed,
rebased and pushed, created, or already there), `1` when any didn't (held,
behind, diverged and left to a person, a rebase its replay stopped, a rebased
branch whose push was held or failed, detached, no upstream, a remote branch
in the way, a checkout not read, a failed fetch or push), as `git push` exits
on a rejected ref, and `2` for usage (an unknown target, the cwd in no
entry's checkout, a third-party or pinned target, `--new-branch` in an
agent's shell). So a rebase a conflict stopped exits `1` here, where
`repos sync` exits `0` on the same: sync reports a branch left to a person,
and a push reports a branch that wasn't pushed.

`--json` prints its own
versioned outcome report: the targets' entries after the fetch — the state
the push acted on, not the state it left: a branch `rebased` or `pushed`
still reads `diverged` or `ahead` there — and one outcome per target
checkout. A rebase is `rebased` (`from`, the tip replaced;
`to`, the new tip; `onto`, the fetched tip; and `push`: `pushed`,
`already_there`, `held`, `push_failed`, or `failed`) or `rebase_refused`
(`why`: `conflicts`, or `already_upstream` with the `commit`), as in sync's
report; the commits replayed and the upstream commits under them are the
branch's `diverged` relation in the entry (`ahead`, `behind`). A `no_upstream` outcome carries `why`, what
`--new-branch` would do with the branch, read as that flag reads it:
`creatable` (only without the flag, which creates it), `merged`,
`default_gone`, or `other_upstream`. The hint the text prints after it words
that reading. A branch the flag would create in an archived repo reads
`needs_human` (`archived_ahead`) with or without it.

The rustdoc of `push.rs` has the details.

### Agents push through `repos push`

The recommended Claude Code settings deny raw `git push` (a `Bash(git push:*)`
prefix rule, with `Bash(repos push --new-branch:*)` beside it) and allow
`Bash(repos:*)`, and agents are instructed to push with `repos push`.
Permission rules hold in every permission mode but match a command's prefix
alone, so a push spelled another way slips past them: guidance, not a
boundary — the host's own rules are the floor.

An agent's `repos push` may rebase its branch: when the registry's branch
diverged (another machine, or another session, pushed to it meanwhile) and
the checkout is clean, the push replays the agent's commits onto origin's and
moves the checkout to them before pushing. The report's `rebased` line is the
agent's cue that the commit ids it reported earlier are stale and that its
checks ran on the old base. A dirty checkout holds it instead, exit `1`,
saying to commit or `git stash -u` and push again.

## Third-party references

**Third-party references are like locked dependencies**: left as they are —
never fetched, no branch compared against a remote, only local work reported
— unless the run names them as targets (a path inside a checkout names its
entry) or passes `--references`, which takes no targets (with them it's a
usage error, exit `2`).

**Refresh.** Then each is refreshed (its `refresh` verdict `act`): fetched
from origin over HTTPS alone, with the same confined fetch, and each branch
fast-forwarded, or moved when shallow, as an owned one would be where clean;
never pushed, so a branch ahead is local-only work, and one diverged or
shallow with local commits is left to a person. `status` takes the same
targets and `--references` to preview a refresh from local refs, and fetches
it under `--fetch`.

**What holds a refresh.** A pin is never fetched; named, it's refused
(`refresh` held `pinned`), and `--references` passes it over. A reference
whose `origin` isn't the registry's repo (a fork, or no URL) is never fetched:
its refresh is held (`refresh held (origin drift)`, held by `entry`) and its
origin-drift line says the fix. A refresh also needs an HTTPS origin naming
the registry's repo, as git resolves it (`insteadOf` applied): the same repo
over SSH, `http://`, or `git://`, or a rewrite of it, holds the refresh
(`refresh held (origin not HTTPS)`, held by `origin_not_https`), never
fetched, with a needs-human line saying the `set-url` fix or naming the
rewrite.

**Partial clones.** A partial clone (a `sparse` reference, cloned
`--filter=blob:none`) lacks the blobs a new tip's checkout needs: a
fast-forward or move in its checkout fetches them on demand from origin
alone, writing objects and no ref, over the one transport origin's URL
names as git resolves it (`insteadOf` applied; SSH or HTTPS, whoever owns
the repo — an owned partial clone resolving to neither is a needs-human
`fetch_url_mismatch`), and only when no other remote is a promisor — both
read again right before, and the action held (`changed`) if origin no longer names the registry's repo over
that transport or another promisor appeared; every other call keeps lazy
fetching off.

## Cloning missing entries

**Each missing entry is cloned** — agents' runs included, and whether or not
busy detection can vouch for every session, since a clone only creates a
dir.

**The recipe.** Owned entries clone over SSH, third-party ones over HTTPS,
each allowed that transport alone; on the entry's `branch` (`--branch`, else
the remote's default), `--depth 1` when `shallow`, cone-mode `sparse` with
`--filter=blob:none`, with `--no-tags` and no submodules or hooks — the
`tagOpt` that records is then unset, so the user's own `git fetch` there
follows tags as in any clone. A `sparse` path is checked at parse: plain
relative directory names, no globs.

**Placement.** The clone is made in a temp dir beside the entry's
(`.<dir>.repos-clone-<pid>-<nonce>`, the nonce random per process, so runs in
separate pid namespaces never share one) and moved into place only when
whole, claiming the path so nothing there is ever cloned over; a failure or
timeout deletes the temp dir, and the unregistered scan names any it finds as
an unfinished clone — one a killed run left, or one still running, to remove
once no `repos sync` is.

**What holds a clone.** Anything at the path — a file, an empty dir, a
dangling symlink — reads as not a repo, never missing; a live session at or
under the path, or another entry's gone worktree recorded there, holds the
clone, and an entry whose `url` another entry shares is never cloned (its dir
may have been a worktree of that repo) — a `needs_human` reason, as is a
missing entry whose repo an unregistered dir at the root already clones (its
origin names it, or a rename of it differing only in case and `-` against
`_`: likely the entry's checkout under another name). The unregistered scan
runs for that whenever the run includes a missing entry, named or not, before
anything is cloned, in `sync` as in `status` (a run with targets doesn't
report what it found); a clone whose origin names the repo by an unrelated
old name isn't caught.

**Read back.** The clone is read back in place (on its branch, tracking
origin's, clean) and reported `cloned`, or `clone_failed` (classified as a
fetch failure is) or `failed`, exit `1`.

The rustdoc of `clone.rs` has the recipe.

## Exit codes

- `0` when the command ran — what the report says is data, not failure
- `1` for a runtime failure: under `sync`, anything that failed (a fetch, git's
  failure or the tool's refusal to run one whose refspec it can't confine; a
  probe; an action git refused — a rebase a conflict stopped is not one, see
  [Sync outcomes](#repos-sync)); under `push`, any target whose branch didn't
  end in sync with its upstream — a rebase held, or stopped by a conflict,
  among them ([Push outcomes](#push-outcomes)); or, under any command, a
  fatal I/O error
- `2` when the caller must change something — usage, a missing or invalid
  registry, git missing or too old, an unknown target, a refused root
  (`root_in_entry`), and `push`'s usage cases

A fatal error prints `error: …` and `hint: …` on stderr; under `--json` it
also prints one error document on stdout, in place of the report — except a usage
error caught before the command runs (an argument the parser rejects, one that
isn't UTF-8, a flag `--brief` can't take), which prints text alone.

## Versions

`repos --version` prints one line: the crate version, the commit the binary
was built from, and the version of each `--json` document it prints —

```
repos <crate> (<commit>[, dirty]) · formats: status <n>, sync <n>, push <n>
```

Each document carries its own as `version` (`sync` and `push` embed a status
report, which carries the status one). A version is bumped on any change to
its document's shape, new fields and variants included, since consumers
parse with strict objects and closed unions; an absent value is `null`, never
an omitted key; the sync and push versions move
with every status bump. The crate version doesn't track the formats, so a
consumer checks the one it parses.

## Testing

`cargo test --workspace` runs integration tests over hermetic fixture
workspaces (`crates/fuz_repos/tests/support`): real repos in a tempdir, each
cloned from a local bare remote, with git's environment cleared (no global or
system config, fixed identities and dates) and no network:

- the `ssh` on `PATH` is the fixture's own, serving fetches and pushes to the
  registry's SSH URLs from the local bare remotes and refusing anything else,
  and SSH failures come from fakes too
- `GIT_EXEC_PATH` is the fixture's — git's own programs, but a
  `git-remote-https` that refuses every URL unless a test serves the bare
  remotes through it (`serve_https`)
- the visibility check reads `file://` repos and a loopback HTTP server
- busy detection reads fixture config dirs whose session files name the
  tests' own child processes

The test files split by command and aspect: `status_*.rs`, `sync.rs` and
`sync_*.rs` (`sync_rebase*.rs` the rebase: its outcomes, its races, and
what the replay writes and refuses), `push_*.rs` (`push_rebase*.rs` a
push's rebase), `cli_*.rs` (the binary's documents, text, and exit
codes), `targets.rs`, `registry_real.rs`, and `golden.rs` with its
`golden/` modules. Helpers a family shares sit beside `support/mod.rs` in
`support/` (`busy`, `cli`, `push`, `rebase`, `remote`, `sync`,
`unregistered`, `worktrees`).

The tests need git 2.44 or newer on `PATH`, and Linux (`/proc`,
`/etc/machine-id`). CI runs these fmt, clippy, and test commands (with
`--locked`, and `--no-fail-fast` on tests) in the `rust` job of
`.github/workflows/check.yml`, beside the gro check.

`src/test/fixtures/repos_status/*.json` are the `repos status --json`,
`repos sync --json`, and `repos push --json` golden documents (report,
narrowed report, busy-detection states, sync report, push report, error
documents), written by `crates/fuz_repos/tests/golden.rs` as the contract TS consumers parse
against — regenerate them with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test --test golden`,
never by hand. Each error `repos status --json` can print has its own
document, `error_report_<kind>.json`; `sync_error_report.json` and
`push_error_report.json` show the same document shape at those commands'
versions. The status documents' TS mirror, `src/lib/repos_status.ts`, is
checked by parsing every status golden with its strict schemas
(`src/test/repos_status.golden.test.ts`); the sync and push documents have
no TS consumer yet.

The goldens hold to these checks. Every report they build is checked for its
structure (`crates/fuz_repos/tests/golden/invariants.rs`): keys and dirs
unique, nothing read of an entry with no repo or a failed probe, the
primary checkout first, an unasked reference's branches its local work
alone, one default-branch reason at most, no session placed while busy
detection is unavailable, relations that fit the clone's depth, and no
fetch time beside a fetch that failed and emptied `FETCH_HEAD`. They re-derive none of
`classify`'s decisions: the integration tests over real git pin those. And
together the goldens cover every variant
(`crates/fuz_repos/tests/golden/coverage.rs`): the status documents —
both reports, `sessions.json`, and the status error documents — carry every
variant of every closed enum the status report and its error document
hold, in each place it can appear (each action's holds — a branch's, a
refresh's, a clone's — their own enum), the sync and push documents
every outcome of theirs and every way a rebase's push and its replay's
refusal can go, and the sync document every hold sync can report. Each enum's
variants are listed once, a list an exhaustive
`match` checks, and the floor counts that list: a new variant fails to
compile until it's listed, and fails the floor until a golden covers it.
