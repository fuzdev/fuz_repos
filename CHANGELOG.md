# @fuzdev/fuz_repos

## 0.81.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: require fuz_css 0.65 (breaking: the `@fuzdev/fuz_css` peer is `>=0.65.0`, was `>=0.62.0`) and fuz_ui 0.210.0 ([#52](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz_repos/pull/52))

  - `ModulesDetail` colors its file-type links and declaration kinds from fuz_css's renamed `--palette_X_50` variables (was `--color_X_50`), which an older fuz_css doesn't define

- feat: `repos sync` rebases a diverged registry branch onto its fetched upstream and pushes it, and `repos push` does the same for the branch it's asked to push, stopping with nothing moved on any conflict (breaking: the `--json` formats are `repos status` 19, `repos sync` 13, and `repos push` 11 — reinstall the `repos` binary with `cargo install --path crates/fuz_repos --locked`) ([7e4f8b0](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz_repos/commit/7e4f8b0))

  - only the registry's branch of an owned entry, neither archived nor pinned, tracking origin's branch of the same name outside a partial clone, is rebased, and only when its commits ahead are on no remote, with no merge or tag among them; a branch's `verdict` action may be `rebase` (`ahead`, `behind`), and any other diverged branch stays a person's, reading `diverged`, `diverged_published`, `diverged_merge`, or `diverged_tagged` (`ReposSyncAction` and `ReposBranchNeedsHuman` in `repos_status.ts`)
  - whatever holds a fast-forward or a push holds the rebase: a diverged branch in a dirty checkout (untracked files count) is held, nothing moved — commit, or `git stash -u`, and run again; `repos push` still pushes a branch ahead from a dirty checkout
  - a rebase commits as you: with no `user.name` and `user.email` configured, it fails saying to set them
  - nothing settles a conflict: no merge driver or `rerere` runs during the replay, so a path a `merge=union` (or any other driver) attribute would have merged conflicts and stops the rebase; `repos sync` exits `0` (the branch is a person's), `repos push` exits `1`, as any push that didn't land
  - the reports say what moved: `repos push`'s `rebased` line names how many upstream commits the branch now sits on, its new tip, and the tip replaced; in `--json`, a branch outcome may be `rebased` (`from`, `to`, `onto`, `push`) or `rebase_refused` (`why`)
  - the readiness fix for a diverged branch names `repos sync <key>` before the by-hand rebase or merge; a diverged branch still isn't ready to publish or in sync with origin

### Patch Changes

- fix: `gitops_publish --format json` carries each failure's message as a string in `failed[]`, secrets masked, and `gitops_sync` compacts only the library data in `repos.json`, keeping a pull request's `draft: false`, an empty `pull_requests`, and the `package.json`'s false values and empty arrays ([2a9f30e](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz_repos/commit/2a9f30e))
- fix: `repos` reads a cherry-pick or revert in progress in a reftable repo, which it read as idle, so `repos sync` and the publish readiness gate no longer treat such a checkout as at rest (reinstall the `repos` binary with `cargo install --path crates/fuz_repos --locked`) ([7e4f8b0](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz_repos/commit/7e4f8b0))

## 0.80.0

### Minor Changes

- rename the package to `@fuzdev/fuz_repos` from `@fuzdev/fuz_gitops`, and move ([1683309](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz_repos/commit/1683309))
  the site to repos.fuz.dev from gitops.fuz.dev. Consumers change the dependency
  name and every `@fuzdev/fuz_gitops/*` import; the `gitops_*` task names, the
  `Gitops*` identifiers and the `gitops.config.ts` filename are unchanged.

## 0.79.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: the gitops tasks read repo state from the `repos` binary and never move a repo; `gitops.config.ts` lists `repos.toml` registry keys (breaking) ([#59](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz_repos/pull/59))

  **Config and the `repos` binary**

  - `gitops.config.ts` exports `{repos: Array<string>}` of registry keys, each listed once (or a no-argument `CreateGitopsConfig` returning it); each repo's dir, URL, branch, visibility, `ci`, and `archived` come from the registry — URL and object entries and `repos_dir` are gone
  - the tasks need the `repos` binary on `PATH` (`cargo install --path crates/fuz_repos --locked` from a fuz_repos checkout) and a registry it finds from the cwd, or `--registry <path>`; `--dir` and `gitops_sync --download` are removed (`repos sync <key>` clones a missing repo)
  - every task fails, naming each problem, on an empty config or a key that's unknown, a third-party reference, missing, not a repo, or unprobed; `gitops_run` no longer skips missing repos
  - `gitops_sync` refuses to run when a public host package's config lists repos the registry declares private (`gitops_config_leaked_private_repos`)

  **No task moves a repo**

  - no task switches a branch, pulls, or installs: `gitops_analyze`, `gitops_plan`, `gitops_validate`, and `gitops_publish` drop `--sync` (`repos sync` moves repos), read repos as they sit, and warn naming each npm repo not at rest
  - `gitops_sync` refuses, before any network, a repo off its registry branch, dirty, or mid-operation (`--allow_dirty` reads them as they sit, warning), then fetches and warns on a branch not in sync with origin, a failed fetch, or an npm repo missing `node_modules` or `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`; `--check` is that readiness report from local refs — no fetch, no `SECRET_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`, nothing written — exiting non-zero when a run would refuse
  - `gitops_publish --wetrun` gates instead of syncing: before the confirmation prompt it runs `repos status --fetch` and refuses, changing nothing, unless every npm repo is on its registry branch, clean (untracked files count), with no operation in progress, in sync with origin or ahead, fetched without error, free of other live Claude Code sessions with busy detection available, and has no `needs_human` reason
  - the executor re-checks each repo right before its `gro publish`, aborting before any npm side effect with the new `not_ready` failure code

  **Task output**

  - under `--emit_json`, or `--format json` or `markdown` without `--outfile`, `gitops_analyze`, `gitops_plan`, `gitops_publish`, and `gitops_run --format json` send their log to stderr — the plan, the readiness block and gate, the executor's progress, and gro's lines after the task — so stdout carries the document or the JSON-lines events alone (gro's two lines before the task runs still lead it); `gro publish` and `gro deploy` send their stdout to stderr then too, and `gitops_publish`'s confirmation prompt is always on stderr
  - `gitops_run --format json` reports a command killed by a signal, or one that never started, with `exit_code: null` (it said `0` for a signal, `-1` for a spawn error), and each result gains `signal`; the text format says `Killed by <signal>`; a runner that throws is reported under its own repo rather than `unknown`

  **Publishing executor**

  - the executor runs `gro publish --no-build --no-pull --branch <entry branch>`, and its dependency-update commits take only the `package.json` and changeset they staged
  - `gro publish` and `gro deploy` run in the foreground — output live, stdin the terminal's so npm can prompt for a one-time password
  - a failed step's message says why on its first line, which the log shows alone, then the end of its stderr, secrets redacted (the markdown report fences it); a failed `gro publish`'s message drops its `Failed to publish <pkg>:` prefix
  - preflight takes the plan and checks no git state (clean workspace, branch, remote — the readiness gate's now): it builds exactly the packages the plan publishes — auto-generated ones too, which it skipped before though `gro publish --no-build` then published them unbuilt — and no others, reads no changesets, drops the per-repo "has no changesets" warnings and the publish-time estimate, and decides its npm registry check by `npm ping`'s exit status, no longer warning on every run; a build logs its "Building" line once
  - secrets are masked in every `--emit_json` event, in the `--format json` report's `events`, and in the `--format markdown` report's failures
  - `gitops_publish --peer_strategy` accepts `gte`, and its help says what it sets: the prefix of a rewritten dependency of any type whose range has none (a wildcard still becomes `^`)

  **Plan**

  - `PublishingPlan` gains `no_changes`, the package names with nothing to publish, and its `info` carries only informational sentences (excluded non-npm repos, dev dependency cycles); `gitops_plan`'s JSON gains `no_changes`, and its markdown lists the info sentences apart from the packages
  - one classification of a version change (`version_change_kind`: `explicit`, `escalation`, `auto`) is shared by the plan's log, markdown, and `--preview`, so the preview labels a publish `explicit` or `auto` where it said `changeset` or `auto_changeset`
  - an auto-generated version change that a later pass raises stays auto, with `needs_bump_escalation`, `existing_bump`, and `required_bump` unset: a dependent listed before its dependency is no longer reported as an escalation too, double-listed in the plan; an escalation's `existing_bump` stays the changesets' bump across passes
  - the plan warns, naming the repo and why, on changeset files that yield no bump for their package — none parses, or none that parses names it — where it skipped the repo silently; its max-iterations warning names the packages one more pass would change in place of a made-up estimate of the iterations left, and no longer fires when the last allowed pass converged the plan
  - `gitops_plan`'s markdown marks breaking changes in a "Breaking" column and summary count, pre-1.0 breaking bumps included, where a "Major" column counted only major bumps

  **Dashboard**

  - `RepoJson` gains an optional `branch`, which `gitops_sync` writes as the registry branch it fetched CI status for, and `Repo` gains `branch` (`main` when the data has none); the table's CI link and the modules page's file links point at that branch rather than `main`
  - `fetch_repo_data` skips the check-runs request for a repo whose registry entry has `ci: false`, and no longer logs "failed to fetch CI status" for a branch with no check runs — only for a failed request, now with its status
  - the pull requests page and `to_pull_requests` list the pull requests of repos without a `homepage` (a cargo repo like `tsv`), which they dropped
  - the pull requests page keys each row by its repo and number, so pull requests sharing a number across repos no longer collide, and the modules nav marks the repo named in the URL hash as selected, which it never matched
  - `PageHeader`'s `repo` prop drops its `{url; pkg_json: null}` variant; the page components no longer wrap `PageFooter` in a second `section`; `ReposTable`, `ReposTree`, `ReposTreeNav`, and `ModulesDetail` drop the branches for a repo without a `package_json` or `repo_url`, which a loaded repo always has (including `ReposTree`'s "failed to load library metadata" summary)
  - the generated `repos.ts` imports `RepoJson` from `repo.svelte.ts` rather than `repo.svelte.js`

  **API (breaking), by module**

  - `gitops_config.ts`
    - `GitopsConfig` is a zod schema as well as a type; adds `parse_gitops_config` and `gitops_config_leaked_private_repos`
    - removes `GitopsRepoConfig`, `RawGitopsConfig`, `RawGitopsRepoConfig`, `GitopsRepoVisibility`, `normalize_gitops_config`, and `create_empty_gitops_config`
  - `local_repo.ts`
    - `LocalRepo` and `LocalRepoPath` carry the registry `entry` (`ReposEntryStatus`) in place of `repo_config` and `repo_git_ssh_url`; `LocalRepoPath` drops `type`, and its `repo_name` is the registry key
    - `local_repos_load` and `local_repo_load` drop `sync`, `allow_dirty`, `git_ops`, and `npm_ops` and load each repo as it sits (both synced by default before)
    - adds `local_repos_resolve`; removes `local_repos_ensure`, `local_repo_locate`, and `LocalRepoMissing`
  - `gitops_task_helpers.ts`
    - `get_gitops_ready` takes `ResolveGitopsReposOptions` (`config`, `registry`, `host`, `log`, `repos_ops`) in place of `GetGitopsReadyOptions`, and returns only `local_repos`
    - adds `resolve_gitops_repos`, `gate_publish_readiness` with `GatePublishReadinessOptions`, and `log_readiness_block`
    - removes `import_gitops_config`, `resolve_gitops_paths`, and `ResolveGitopsPathsOptions`
  - `operations.ts` / `operations_defaults.ts`
    - `GitopsOperations` gains `repos`: adds `ReposOperations` and `ReposCommandOutput` (`operations.ts`) and `default_repos_operations` (`operations_defaults.ts`)
    - `ProcessOperations.spawn` is replaced by `run_interactive` (its `stdout` option routes the child's stdout to ours or our stderr; a failure carries `stderr_tail`, the end of its stderr, cut by `output_tail` to `OUTPUT_TAIL_MAX_LINES` and `OUTPUT_TAIL_MAX_CHARS`, all three added to `operations_defaults.ts`)
    - `GitOperations` keeps only `current_commit_hash` (without `branch`), `add`, and `commit` (which takes the `files` to commit): removes `current_branch_name`, `check_clean_workspace`, `checkout`, `pull`, `switch_branch`, `has_remote`, `add_and_commit`, `has_changes`, `list_uncommitted_files`, `tag`, `push_tag`, `stash`, `stash_pop`, and `has_file_changed`
    - `NpmOperations.install` is removed, and `NpmOperations.wait_for_package`'s failure drops `timeout`
    - `BuildOperations.build_package` drops `log`
    - `PreflightOperations.run_preflight_checks` takes `RunPreflightChecksOptions`, without `git_ops`
  - `git_operations.ts`
    - `git_commit` takes the files to commit, and `git_current_commit_hash_required` drops its `branch` parameter
    - removes `git_add_and_commit`, `git_tag`, `git_push_tag`, `git_has_changes`, `git_has_file_changed`, `git_list_uncommitted_files`, `git_stash`, `git_stash_pop`, `git_switch_branch`, `git_current_branch_name_required`, `git_check_clean_workspace_as_boolean`, and `git_has_remote`
  - `preflight_checks.ts`
    - `run_preflight_checks` takes the plan's `version_changes` and drops `git_ops`; `RunPreflightChecksOptions` drops `changeset_ops` and `preflight_options` for a top-level `log`
    - `PreflightOptions` is removed (`skip_changesets`, `skip_build_validation`, `estimate_time`, and the `required_branch` and `check_remote` it had)
    - `PreflightResult` drops `repos_with_changesets`, `repos_without_changesets`, `estimated_duration`, and `npm_username`
  - `multi_repo_publisher.ts`
    - `PublishingOptions` gains `registry` and `child_stdout`
  - `npm_registry.ts`
    - removes `get_package_info`, `package_exists`, and `PackageInfo`
    - `check_package_available` and `wait_for_package` take a trailing `NpmRegistryDeps` (`run_npm`, `wait`, `now`), defaulting to `default_npm_registry_deps`
  - `publishing_event.ts` / `publishing_event_handler.ts`
    - `PublishingErrorCode` gains `not_ready` and drops `auth`, `dependency`, `build`, and `other`, which were never emitted
    - removes `null_handler`; `masking_handler` drops its `mask` parameter, always masking with `mask_secrets`; `stdout_handler` takes an optional line writer
  - `publishing_plan.ts` / `publish_steps.ts`
    - adds `version_change_kind` and `VersionChangeKind`; `PublishStep`'s `via` is a `VersionChangeKind`, and `PublishStepVia` is removed
    - `publishing_plan.ts` no longer re-exports `log_publishing_plan` and `LogPlanOptions`; import them from `publishing_plan_logging.ts`
  - `dependency_graph.ts` / `graph_validation.ts`
    - `DependencyGraph`'s constructor takes the repos in place of `init_from_repos`, and `analyze` is its method, returning `DependencyAnalysis` (moved from `graph_validation.ts` to `dependency_graph.ts`) without `missing_peers`, which listed every external peer dependency; the formatters and loggers in `log_helpers.ts` take a `DependencyAnalysis`
    - removes `DependencyGraphBuilder` (`build_from_repos`, `analyze`, and `compute_publishing_order`, which is `graph.topological_sort(true)`), `get_dependents`, `get_dependencies`, `DependencySpec`'s `resolved`, and `DependencyNode`'s `repo` and `publishable`; `gitops_analyze`'s JSON drops each node's `publishable` (`DependencyGraphJson`) and the analysis's `missing_peers`
    - `validate_dependency_graph` takes only the repos and never throws or logs, reporting cycles and a failed sort in its result: drops the `log`, `throw_on_prod_cycles`, `log_cycles`, and `log_order` options
  - `ci_reconcile.ts`
    - `CiReconcileInput` drops `checkable`: a configured repo that isn't present fails the load
  - `fetch_repo_data.ts` / `github.ts`
    - `fetch_repo_data` takes one `FetchRepoDataOptions` object (`local_repos`, `token`, `cache`, `log`, `delay`, `github_api_version`, `fetch`) in place of six positional parameters
    - `fetch_github_check_runs` returns a `Result` whose `value` is `null` for no check runs, apart from a failure (`status`, `message`), and it and `fetch_github_pull_requests` take a `fetch` option
  - `output_helpers.ts`
    - adds `route_human_output`, `output_is_machine`, and `WriteStdout`; `OutputOptions` gains `write_stdout`
  - the task modules
    - `gitops_run.task.ts`'s `Args` and `task` are `@nodocs` like every other task's
    - the task bodies are exported, `@nodocs`, as test seams: `run_gitops_run` (`GitopsRunDeps`, with `GitopsRunOutcome`, `GitopsRunCommandOutput`, and `GitopsRunResult`), `run_gitops_plan` (`GitopsPlanDeps`), `run_gitops_analyze` (`GitopsAnalyzeDeps`), `run_gitops_publish` (`GitopsPublishDeps`, with `to_child_stdout` and `format_failure_markdown`), and `prepare_gitops_sync` (`GitopsSyncDeps`)

  **Added modules**

  - `repos_status.ts` — zod schemas for the `repos status --json` document (`ReposStatusDocument`, `ReposStatusReport`, `ReposStatusErrorReport`, `ReposEntryStatus`, and the shapes inside them) and `REPOS_STATUS_FORMAT_VERSION`
  - `repos_status_load.ts` — `load_repos_status`, `parse_repos_status_output`, `to_repos_command`, `REPOS_INSTALL_COMMAND`, and `ReposStatusLoadFailure`
  - `repo_readiness.ts` — the readiness predicates (`repo_readiness_at_rest`, `repo_readiness_for_publish`, `repo_readiness_for_gen`, `check_publish_readiness`, `check_gen_readiness`, `repos_not_at_rest`) and formatters (`format_repo_readiness_problem`, `format_readiness_ahead`, `format_readiness_block`), with `RepoReadiness`, `RepoReadinessProblem`, `RepoReadinessFormatOptions`, and `ReadinessAhead`

  **Removed modules**

  - `repo_ops.ts` (`walk_repo_files`, `collect_repo_files`, `should_exclude_path`, `get_repo_paths`, `RepoPath`, `WalkOptions`, `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_DIRS`, `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS`)
  - `resolved_gitops_config.ts` (`resolve_gitops_config`, `ResolvedGitopsConfig`)
  - `config_reconcile.ts` (`reconcile_configs`, `ConfigDrift`, `ConfigDriftKind`, `IntrinsicField`, `NamedRepos`): the registry is the one source of each repo's facts, so there are no configs to reconcile
  - `paths.ts` (`DEFAULT_REPOS_DIR`)

  - `RawGitopsRepoConfig` accepts optional `visibility` (`'public' | 'private'`, defaults to `'public'`), `ci`, and `archived` (defaults to `false`)
  - `ci` defaults to `true` for public repos and `false` for private ones, overridable per-repo
  - `reconcile_ci` flags drift between a repo's declared `ci` and its actual workflow files, skipping archived repos
  - `gro gitops_validate` now runs `ci_reconcile` and hard-fails (throws) on any error from any step — a production dependency cycle, a plan error, or CI drift — instead of completing with a warning; warnings stay non-fatal
  - not yet consumed by sync/publish
