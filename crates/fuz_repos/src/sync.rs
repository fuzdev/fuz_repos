//! `repos sync`: fetch, classify, and act on each branch's verdict — the
//! fast-forwards, shallow moves, rebases, and pushes `status` previews — and
//! on each missing entry's, cloning it.
//!
//! Each action's git calls are in `sync/step.rs`, a rebase's replay and move
//! in `sync/rebase.rs`; this doc says what they rely on and the races they
//! leave.
//!
//! **The pipeline.** Sync is `status --fetch` (the same probe pool, the same
//! hardened fetch writing remote-tracking refs alone, the same visibility
//! checks) and then acts:
//!
//! 1. Probe every entry, fetching the ones `status --fetch` fetches first:
//!    owned and not pinned, with an `origin` URL whose fetch, as git
//!    resolves it (`insteadOf` applied), reaches the registry's repo — one
//!    a rewrite sends elsewhere is held unfetched (`fetch_url_mismatch`) —
//!    or a third-party reference the run refreshes whose origin is the
//!    registry's repo, fetched over HTTPS alone.
//! 2. Read the live sessions — after the fetches, which can take minutes,
//!    so a session started meanwhile still holds — scope them to the
//!    checkouts probed, and classify.
//! 3. Act on each branch's verdict: an `act` fast-forward, move, rebase, or
//!    push is made; everything else is reported as it stands. Entries
//!    sharing a repo act together, one after another, each branch once;
//!    repos act in parallel, and so do clones (`clone`), each its own
//!    entry's — entry dirs are plain names under the root, no two alike, so
//!    no clone lands in another's.
//!
//! **Never** a force-push, a tag pushed, a remote branch created (the
//! user's `repos push --new-branch` alone creates one), a conflict
//! resolved, a commit of new content, a rewrite of a commit any remote
//! holds, a merge that isn't a fast-forward, a clone over anything at an
//! entry's path, a deleted branch, or a pruned worktree (the origin fetch's
//! `--prune` deletes only remote-tracking refs gone upstream); a pin, once
//! there, is never touched (its verdicts never act), and a third-party
//! reference only when the run refreshes it — named as a target, or under
//! `--references` — and then never pushed. An entry whose probe failed has
//! no verdicts, so nothing in it acts. An agent's run pushes and rebases as
//! a person's does — every branch ahead or diverged that nothing holds, busy
//! detection keeping it off live sessions' checkouts — and `repos push` (the
//! `push` module) pushes one checkout's branch through this module's one
//! push (`Actor::push`), rebasing it first, when it diverged, through this
//! module's one rebase (`Actor::rebase_and_push`).
//!
//! **The one rewrite: a rebase.** A registry branch diverged from origin's
//! — local-only commits here, new ones there, the everyday case of two
//! machines committing to one `main` — has its local-only commits replayed
//! onto the fetched tip and is then pushed, a fast-forward of linear
//! history. Only commits no remote holds are replayed — a branch ahead by a
//! commit any remote-tracking ref holds is a person's — as new commits with
//! the same changes, messages, authors, and author dates, the committer the
//! identity the one running the tool configured; nothing is resolved, by
//! the tool or by a merge driver, so any conflict leaves the branch exactly
//! as it was. Which branches: `classify`'s `rebase_blocker`.
//!
//! **The verdict is a plan; git is the check.** Right before each action,
//! sync re-reads the live sessions (a hold when busy detection has become
//! unavailable, or a session now works where the action would), then
//! re-checks what the action relies on, then lets git refuse whatever else
//! changed — and where git's own refusal can't cover a race, checks after
//! the fact what the action did:
//!
//! - **A fast-forward in place** — a branch no checkout has — is `git fetch
//!   . <tip>:refs/heads/<b>`, a fetch from the repo itself of the exact
//!   upstream commit: git refuses anything but a fast-forward, refuses a
//!   branch checked out (or being rebased or bisected) in any worktree, and
//!   updates the ref only if it still holds what git read. It's confined as
//!   the remote fetch is (no tags, no pruning, no `FETCH_HEAD`, no
//!   submodules, no commit-graph or bundles) and to local transport
//!   (`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=file`), so an `insteadOf` on `.` can't reach the
//!   network; the source is named by its object id, so wherever a rewrite
//!   sends it, the ref can only move to that commit. Git's fetch writes
//!   through a symbolic ref to its target, past its checked-out check, so
//!   a branch that's a symbolic ref never acts (`BranchStatus::symref`), and
//!   right before the fetch sync re-checks that it hasn't become one; one
//!   made in the instant between is the window left.
//! - **A fast-forward in a checkout** is `git merge --ff-only` of the tip,
//!   run only after the checkout's status reads it still on the branch and
//!   clean: git's merge refuses only changes it would overwrite, so a dirty
//!   tree would otherwise still move. `--no-overwrite-ignore` keeps it from
//!   replacing an ignored file (a local `.env`) with a tracked one; the
//!   branch's `mergeOptions` (`--squash`, `--autostash`, …) are overridden.
//!   The merge moves whatever branch HEAD is on when it runs, so afterwards
//!   the branch must read the tip: a HEAD switched in the instant between
//!   the status and the merge fails the action, naming what moved instead —
//!   a fast-forward only, so nothing is lost. A branch another hand moved
//!   past the tip meanwhile is held (`changed`).
//! - **A shallow move in place** is `git update-ref --no-deref <b> <tip>
//!   <old>`, after re-counting the branch's commits on no remote at `<old>`
//!   (none), finding it checked out nowhere, and finding it no symbolic
//!   ref: the update is a compare-and-swap on the commit just counted, so no
//!   commit landing meanwhile can be dropped, and it never writes through a
//!   symbolic ref (one made in the instant before is replaced by a plain
//!   ref, its target untouched). Git doesn't check a checkout for
//!   `update-ref`: a checkout switching to the branch in that instant would
//!   find its HEAD moved under its files, reading as a staged reverse diff —
//!   the files and the old commit stay, nothing is lost.
//! - **A shallow move in a checkout** is `git switch -C <b> <tip>`, after the
//!   same status check and re-count: it refuses local changes it would
//!   overwrite, an ignored file it would replace, and a branch checked out
//!   in another worktree. (`merge --ff-only` can't: the fetched tip's history
//!   stops at the shallow root. `reset --keep` would replace ignored files.)
//!   It resets the branch without a compare-and-swap, so a commit landing in
//!   the instant between the re-count and the switch would be dropped from
//!   the branch: the switch writes the branch's reflog whatever the config
//!   says, and afterwards the reflog's previous value must be the commit
//!   counted — else the action fails, naming the commit, which the reflog
//!   still holds. A branch another hand moved to the tip itself meanwhile
//!   gets no entry from the switch, and is held (`changed`): the move
//!   wasn't sync's.
//!
//! - **A rebase** is `git replay --onto <tip> <tip>..<b>`, the move of the
//!   branch to what it made, and then the push below, of the replayed tip.
//!   Right before, as a push re-reads: the checkout it's on still on the
//!   branch and clean (untracked files count), the branch the same commit,
//!   upstream, and ref on origin, no symbolic ref, and that commit still the
//!   counted commits ahead of and behind the remote-tracking ref, each one
//!   ahead still on no remote-tracking ref, with no merge among them and no
//!   tag on one — else held (`dirty_checkout`, `changed`).
//!
//!   The replay merges in memory: it writes commit objects and nothing
//!   else — no ref, index, working tree, or hook — so a conflict (exit `1`)
//!   stops with nothing moved (`RebaseRefusal::Conflicts`), no rebase left
//!   in progress. Nothing settles one: `rerere` is off, so no recorded
//!   resolution is applied, and no merge driver runs — each one the config
//!   defines is replaced, for the replay alone, by a command that fails,
//!   git's built-in `union` too, and a path with no `merge` attribute takes
//!   the plain text merge whatever `merge.default` says — so a path a
//!   driver would have merged is a conflict like any other. A path marked
//!   unmergeable, `-merge` or `binary`, still is: the attributes are read
//!   from the tree of the commit replayed (`--attr-source`), with
//!   `info/attributes` and `core.attributesFile` over it, never from the
//!   checkout the replay runs in, which may be on another branch.
//!   An attribute only the upstream's new commits add isn't in that tree:
//!   a path they mark `-merge` is text-merged where `git rebase`, run in a
//!   checkout at the upstream, would conflict. The committer is an
//!   identity the user set (`user.useConfigOnly`): with no `user.name` and
//!   `user.email`, in config or the environment, git refuses rather than
//!   derive one from the login and host name, and the action fails saying
//!   what to set. It prints the ref update it would make only for a ref
//!   named in the range, so the branch is named by ref, and the old value
//!   it prints must be the commit classified (`changed`). A git whose
//!   replay updates refs itself unless told otherwise is told to print
//!   (`--ref-action=print`, passed when its usage names the option, and the
//!   config key of the same meaning, which a git without it ignores); the
//!   branch must still hold the classified commit after, and one that
//!   doesn't, with nothing printed, fails the action saying git moved it —
//!   its checkout then reads changed, a person's to look at. A replay keeps
//!   a commit whose change the upstream already has as an empty commit,
//!   where `git rebase` drops it: one that came out empty though its
//!   original wasn't stops the rebase (`AlreadyUpstream`), the tool making
//!   neither choice. Objects a stopped replay wrote are unreachable, git's
//!   to collect. A replay signs nothing, whatever `commit.gpgSign` says.
//!
//!   The move, for a branch no checkout has, is `git update-ref --no-deref
//!   <b> <new> <old>` once it reads checked out nowhere and no symbolic
//!   ref: a compare-and-swap on the commit replayed, so a commit landing
//!   meanwhile is never dropped (held, `changed`), its reflog written
//!   whatever the config says (`core.logAllRefUpdates`), as the switch's
//!   is, so the commits replaced stay reachable. As a shallow move in
//!   place, git checks no checkout for it: a checkout switching to the
//!   branch in that instant, or a rebase of it begun in another worktree,
//!   finds the branch moved under it — the old commit stays in the reflog.
//!   For a checked-out branch it's the shallow move's `git switch -C <b>
//!   <new>`, after the status check and the branch's commit are read again,
//!   the replay done: it refuses local changes it would overwrite and an
//!   ignored file it would replace (`reset --keep` replaces ignored files;
//!   `merge --ff-only` can't follow a replay), and leaves the same window —
//!   no compare-and-swap, so the reflog's previous value must be the commit
//!   replayed, else the action fails naming the commit the reflog holds.
//!   A HEAD switched away in the instant between the status and the switch
//!   is switched back to the branch.
//!
//!   Then the push, with every re-check of its own, the sessions among
//!   them. Short of pushed — held, or failed at the remote — the branch
//!   stays rebased and ahead, the next run's to push (or, when origin moved
//!   again, to rebase again). A partial clone's branch is never rebased
//!   (`classify`), so no replay needs an object the clone lacks.
//!
//! - **A push** is `git send-pack` of the commit the branch held when
//!   probed — or the tip a rebase just moved it to — to its upstream's ref
//!   on origin (`push_target`: a branch, never `refs/heads/HEAD`), so a
//!   commit landing after classifying is never pushed unseen — sent to the
//!   registry's URL over SSH as written, never through `origin`
//!   (`SEND_PACK_ARGS` says why: no rewrite or remote config reaches it).
//!   Right before, sync re-reads the branch — the same commit, upstream,
//!   and ref on origin, no symbolic ref, else `changed` — re-reads where a
//!   push through origin would go (`git remote get-url --push --all`,
//!   `pushurl` and `pushInsteadOf` applied: exactly one URL, the registry's
//!   repo over SSH as `push_urls_match` reads it — the host git connects to
//!   and the path there, never the URL's text — else held `push_url`:
//!   origin pushing elsewhere is a person's to sort out, even though the
//!   push itself never reads it), and re-counts the commits ahead of the
//!   remote-tracking ref (the same count, the ref an ancestor, else
//!   `changed`). The push is under a lease on that fetched tip
//!   (`--force-with-lease=<ref>:<fetched>`), a compare-and-swap: git
//!   refuses unless the remote's branch is exactly what the fetch saw, and
//!   the remote updates it only from the value it advertised. A lease lifts
//!   git's own fast-forward check, so the ancestor re-check is what keeps
//!   it one: together, a strict fast-forward of exactly the fetched tip,
//!   never a force over work the fetch didn't see (a host refusing
//!   non-fast-forwards checks it again). A remote branch moved since the
//!   fetch — forward, back, or deleted, and deleted and recreated anywhere
//!   but the fetched tip — fails the lease and is held (`changed`) for a
//!   rerun, which reclassifies it: a deleted branch reads `gone`, so no
//!   push recreates one (the user's `repos push --new-branch` alone does,
//!   and only while it has commits on no remote). The push sends nothing
//!   but the one ref — no tags, no push options, no push certificate — with
//!   git's own remote command, over SSH only (`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=ssh`),
//!   batch-mode as the fetch. The remote's own refusal (a ruleset, a hook)
//!   or a host unreachable fails (`push_failed`, classified). Once pushed —
//!   or found there already, another hand's push of the very commit since
//!   the fetch — the remote-tracking ref moves to the commit by
//!   compare-and-swap on the fetched tip (`record_push`), so `status` reads
//!   the branch in sync without a refetch; a fetch that moved it meanwhile
//!   wins. A failed or refused fetch holds every push, so that ref is one
//!   the fetch confined.
//!
//! - **A new remote branch** is `repos push --new-branch`'s alone (sync
//!   never creates one): the same send-pack to the registry's URL, of the
//!   commit classified to `refs/heads/<b>` under the branch's own name,
//!   under a lease that no such ref exists (`--force-with-lease=<ref>:`),
//!   so a branch created there since the fetch is never overwritten
//!   (`changed`). Right before, the same re-checks as a push's, and the
//!   remote-tracking ref origin's fetch refspec maps it to: none holds it
//!   for a person, and one the fetch wrote, at another commit, is a branch
//!   origin has, never adopted. Then, as `git push -u`, that ref by
//!   compare-and-swap on none, and the upstream config (`Step::create`
//!   says what a run stopped partway leaves, and how the next finishes it).
//!
//! - **A clone** of a missing entry (the `clone` module doc has the recipe)
//!   is made in a temp dir beside the entry's and moved into place only
//!   when whole, never over anything there. Right before, sync re-reads the
//!   live sessions — one now working at or under the path holds it (`busy`)
//!   — and re-checks that nothing is at the path (`changed`). Busy
//!   detection that's unavailable holds no clone, and neither does an agent
//!   running the tool: a clone writes a new dir, and no remote.
//!
//! A branch deleted since classifying is held (`changed`) wherever the
//! action reads it.
//!
//! **A partial clone** (a sparse reference, cloned `--filter=blob:none`)
//! lacks the blobs a new tip's checkout needs: the fast-forward and the
//! move in a checkout fetch them on demand (`LazyFetch`), from origin
//! alone over the transport its URL names as git resolves it — the URL the
//! fetch connects to, `insteadOf` applied (`lazy_transport`) — writing
//! objects and no ref; one resolving to neither SSH nor HTTPS is a
//! person's (`fetch_url_mismatch`). Right before the checkout, that URL is
//! read again, and a URL that no longer names the registry's repo over
//! that transport holds the action (`changed`), as does another promisor
//! remote configured since, which git would ask too. Every other call
//! keeps lazy fetching off.
//!
//! Each action moves one branch and touches at most the one checkout it's on
//! (classify holds a fast-forward, move, or rebase on several; a push
//! touches none), re-reading what it relies on right before, so actions
//! within a repo don't depend on their order. The ones that rewrite a
//! working tree run under `CHECKOUT_TIMEOUT`, not the local timeout: git
//! killed mid-checkout leaves the files half-written.
//!
//! **What runs.** The runner's hardening holds (the `git` module doc): no
//! hook, fsmonitor, or alternate-refs command runs, so nothing a fetch or
//! fast-forward brings in is executed — the `reference-transaction` hook
//! included, and `send-pack` runs no `pre-push` hook at all. Programs the
//! local config names — filter drivers such as Git LFS's smudge, the gpg
//! program `merge.verifySignatures` calls, SSH as configured
//! (`core.sshCommand`) — are the user's own and run as in any merge,
//! checkout, or push they'd make. A merge driver is the exception: a
//! rebase's replay runs none, since one that merges a path settles a
//! conflict, which the tool never does.
