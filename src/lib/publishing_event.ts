/**
 * Structured events for multi-repo publishing.
 *
 * Publishing emits a stream of tagged events alongside its human-readable logging,
 * so machine consumers (CI, dashboards) can follow a run step by step. Every run
 * opens with a `run_started` event carrying `wetrun`: when `false`, the run is a dry
 * run and every `package_completed` is a prediction (its `commit` is `'simulated'`)
 * rather than an applied change. A run's `run_finished` summary is derived from the
 * same event list via `summarize_events`, so the stream and the summary never drift.
 *
 * Events are consumed through a `PublishingEventHandler` sink (see
 * `publishing_event_handler.ts`).
